# Blog Post Version History Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation plan for tracking version history in Hugo blog posts, with archived versions linked at the bottom of current posts.

## 1. Frontmatter Schema
```yaml
version: "1.1"
version_history:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: 2025-01-15
    changes: "Initial publication"
    archived_url: "/archived/posts/your-post-v1-0/"
  - version: "1.1" 
    date: 2025-01-20
    changes: "Updated analysis section, added new examples"
    current: true
```

## 2. Directory Structure
```
content/
├── posts/ (current versions)
└── archived/
    └── posts/ (historical versions)
```

## 3. Layout Updates
Add version history section to `layouts/_default/single.html` at bottom of posts.
