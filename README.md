## Website Structure

Your website is organized into several main sections:

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ version.sh     # Full version management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create-post.sh # Content creation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ archive.sh     # Content archiving
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/           # Custom templates
â”œâ”€â”€ static/           # Images and static files
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           # CSS and processed assets
â””â”€â”€ config.toml       # Site configuration
```

## Quick Start

### One-Time Setup
```bash
# Setup the simplified version command (optional)
./scripts/setup-version-alias.sh
source ~/.zshrc  # or restart terminal

# Start local development server
hugo server -D
```

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# 1. Edit any content file and save
# 2. Create a new version (if you want version tracking)
version "1.1" "Updated examples and analysis"

# 3. View changes locally
hugo server -D
```

## Content Management

### Creating New Content

#### Blog Posts
```bash
# Quick creation
./create-post.sh "Your Post Title"

# Manual creation: create content/posts/your-post.md
```

#### Other Content Types
- **Main Themes**: Add to `content/main-themes/`
- **Investing**: Add to `content/investing/` 
- **Product**: Add to `content/product/`
- **About/Experience**: Add to `content/about/experience/`

### Editing Content

All content is written in Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Content Title"
description: "SEO description"
date: 2025-01-25
author: Terry Chen
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
---

# Your Content

Write your content here using Markdown...
```

### Version History System

This site includes an automated version history system that tracks changes to your content over time.

#### How It Works
- **Git-based**: Leverages Git commits for version tracking
- **Automatic**: Script handles all the technical details
- **Reader-friendly**: Shows version history at bottom of posts
- **GitHub integration**: Readers can view exact changes via GitHub

#### Creating Versions

**Simple Method (Recommended):**
```bash
# Edit your content file and save
# Then run:
version "1.1" "Description of what you changed"
```

**Advanced Method:**
```bash
./scripts/version.sh content/posts/your-post.md "1.1" "Description of changes"
```

#### What Readers See
At the bottom of posts with version history:
```
ðŸ“‹ Version History

v1.1 (Jan 25, 2025) [ðŸ”— View changes]
     Updated examples and improved analysis

v1.0 (Jan 15, 2025) [ðŸ”— View changes]  
     Initial publication

ðŸ’¡ Click "View changes" to see exactly what changed between versions
```

#### Version History Features
- **No file duplication** - one file per post
- **Complete change tracking** - see exactly what changed
- **Professional presentation** - clean, accessible interface
- **GitHub integration** - leverage GitHub's diff viewer
- **SEO friendly** - only current versions indexed

### Archiving Content

Move older content to the archived section:

```bash
# Interactive archiving
./archive.sh

# Direct archiving
./archive-note.sh content/posts/old-post.md

# Tag-based archiving (keeps file in place)
./tag-as-archived.sh content/posts/old-post.md
```

}

.post-title {

}
```

```

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
Your site deploys automatically via GitHub Actions when you push to the main branch.

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy
./reset-github-pages.sh

# Or manually:
hugo --minify
# Then commit and push the generated files
```

### GitHub Pages Settings
- **Source**: Deploy from `gh-pages` branch
- **Custom domain**: terrylinhaochen.github.io
- **HTTPS**: Enabled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Content not showing up:**
- Check frontmatter syntax
- Ensure `draft: false` (or omit draft field)
- Verify file is in correct directory

**Images not displaying:**
- Verify path starts with `/images/`
- Check file exists in `static/images/`
- Ensure correct file permissions

**Version history not working:**
- Ensure script has execute permissions: `chmod +x scripts/v.sh`
- Check Git repository is properly initialized
- Verify frontmatter formatting

**Local development issues:**
- Restart Hugo server: `Ctrl+C` then `hugo server -D`
- Clear browser cache: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F5` (PC)
- Check for syntax errors in markdown files

**Deployment issues:**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify `gh-pages` branch settings
- Run `./reset-github-pages.sh` to force rebuild

### Getting Help

1. **Local testing**: Always test with `hugo server -D` before pushing
2. **Version control**: Use version history system to track changes
3. **GitHub integration**: Leverage GitHub's tools for collaboration and history
4. **Incremental changes**: Make small, focused changes to isolate issues

### Development Workflow

1. **Start development server**: `hugo server -D`
2. **Create/edit content**: Use scripts or edit files directly
3. **Test changes locally**: Preview at `http://localhost:1313`
4. **Create version**: `version "1.1" "Description"`
5. **Commit and push**: Git will handle deployment automatically

This setup provides a professional, maintainable blog with powerful version tracking and easy content management.
