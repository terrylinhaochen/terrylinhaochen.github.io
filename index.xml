&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Despite advances in large language model (LLM) capability, their fundamental limitation of not being able to store context over long-lived interactions persists. In this paper, a novel human-inspired three-tiered memory architecture is presented that addresses these limitations through biomimetic design principles rooted in cognitive science. Our approach aligns the human working memory with the LLM context window, episodic memory with vector stores of experience-based knowledge, and semantic memory with structured knowledge triplets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 in Review</title><link>https://chenterry.com/posts/year_in_review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/posts/year_in_review/</guid><description>Reflecting on 2024: lessons from founding Cogno, the importance of hands-on product development, choosing college over dropping out, and key insights for first-time founders.</description></item><item><title>Realtime Conversational Learning Aid</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/groupal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/groupal/</guid><description>AI-powered study group assistant that analyzes real-time conversations, detects misconceptions, and facilitates deeper learning through Socratic questioning and contextual knowledge retrieval.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Prototyping of LLM Enabled Webapps</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/prototyping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/prototyping/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="peptalk-ai-journaling-tool">PepTalk: AI Journaling Tool&lt;/h3>
