# Visual Style Prompt

A wide horizontal digital illustration in a minimalist retro style inspired by 20th-century screen printing and risograph art. The image features a single subject — natural, abstract, or architectural — isolated in a flat, open environment with generous negative space. Bold black outlines define the forms, while halftone grain textures overlay flat, matte color planes. The palette includes vintage tones like rust orange, deep blue, olive green, mustard, and dusty pink, but allows for subtle variation. A floating natural object in the form of a geometric shape (moon / sun) may be placed asymmetrically to balance the composition. The subject is off-center, leaving most of the canvas empty to evoke stillness, simplicity, and thoughtful design. The aesthetic merges East Asian minimalism with modern graphic abstraction. This style, draw one with mount rainier.
