# LLM Coaching System

Experience our AI coaching system firsthand—upload a coaching conversation and see how it identifies learning patterns and suggests peer connections.

This system analyzes coaching conversations to identify specific learning regulation gaps and connects students with peers who've successfully worked through similar challenges.

## Features

- **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies cognitive, metacognitive, and emotional regulation gaps
- **Peer Matching**: Connects you with students who've overcome similar challenges
- **Conversation Facilitation**: Structured guidance for productive peer learning
- **Action Planning**: Helps create concrete next steps for skill development
