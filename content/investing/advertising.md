## Understanding the Business of Search Ads

Work in progress for understanding the search ads business.

### Defining the Business
Search ads appear on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) for keyword queries, part of Pay-Per-Click (PPC) marketing. Ads display based on bids, at top/bottom of results or alongside organics. This auction model uses bid, quality, and relevance for placement. It connects advertisers to high-intent users, charging per click for engagement-based efficiency.

#### Advertisements
Text ads include headlines, descriptions, site links; extensions add calls or locations. Formats like shopping ads feature images/prices. Revenue efficiency uses Click-Through Rate (CTR) (impressions to clicks), Cost Per Click (CPC) (cost per click), Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) (revenue/ad spend). High CTR (e.g., 6% in dating) shows relevance; ROAS >4:1 signals e-commerce success. Metrics guide optimization for lower costs, higher conversions.

#### Search as a Surface for Advertisements
Search captures active queries for targeted ad interception. Platforms provide traffic to advertisers lacking organic visibility, with fast, measurable Return on Investment (ROI). Global revenue grows at 9.21% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to 2029. Flow: advertisers bid on keywords; real-time auctions select ads; clicks trigger payments; analytics refine. Solves low-reach issues via intent exposure, while sustaining user experience.

### Key Players & Competitive Landscape
Google dominates with 89.62% share (March 2025), followed by Bing (3-6%). TikTok, Meta expand via social/video surfaces; North American spend hits $235.22B by 2029. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and unique surfaces differentiate.

| Platform | Key Features & Surfaces | Differentiation |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Google | Web/mobile; text/shopping/video; AI bidding. | Vast data for targeting; multi-device. |
| Bing | Web; Microsoft ecosystem. | Cheaper CPC; enterprise focus. |
| TikTok | Video search keywords; conversion support; AI suggestions. | Short-form integration; 20% uplift with in-feed. |
| Meta | Social search in feeds. | Demographic personalization. |
| Amazon | E-commerce product ads. | Direct purchase conversion. |

TikTok (https://ads.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/introducing-search-ads-campaign) blends ads with videos for 188% efficiency in cases. Social and video surfaces extend traditional search by embedding ads in dynamic, user-generated content environments. 

On TikTok, search ads integrate seamlessly with short-form videos on the search results page, supporting video and image carousel formats. AI tools like keyword suggestions, smart thumbnails, and multi-text ads match creatives to queries, boosting relevance. This captures high-intent moments during video exploration, with benefits including 20% average conversion increases when paired with in-feed ads, and case studies showing ROAS improvements up to 2x. 

For Meta (Facebook/Instagram), ads appear in search results and Explore tabs, leveraging social feeds for contextual targeting. Placements include feeds, Stories, and search surfaces, where ads surface based on user interests and behaviors. In 2025, features emphasize AI-optimized campaigns and shoppable formats, enhancing engagement in social discovery with projected higher ROI through demographic precision. These surfaces differentiate by blending ads with entertaining content, reducing ad fatigue and improving click-through via visual and interactive elements.

### The Technology & Strategy
Real-time auctions use Machine Learning (ML) for ranking, matching, analytics. Differentiation: predictive bids, personalization. Google scores relevance; TikTok AI for creatives. Strategies balance bids with relevance to maximize CTR/ROAS.

### Finding the Edge
Advantages from data scale, algorithms, ecosystems (Google targeting, Microsoft ties). Intent focus, ROI tracking enable scaling. Competitor bids, privacy features sharpen edges.

### Prototyping & Explorations

#### Generative AI in Search Ads
AI automates bidding/targeting/creatives via real-time analysis, reducing manual work. Inefficiencies: data biases cause mismatches; fraud inflates costs; privacy limits data, raising CPC/lowering ROAS. Objectives: maximize revenue per query, improve personalization, cut waste ethically.
