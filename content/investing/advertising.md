## Understanding the Business of Search Ads

Work in progress for understanding the search ads business.

### Defining the Business
Search ads are a form of online advertising that appear on search engine results pages (SERPs) when users search for specific keywords related to the advertised product or service. They are a key component of pay-per-click (PPC) marketing. These ads are displayed based on the keywords advertisers bid on, and they typically appear at the top or bottom of the SERP, or next to the organic search results.
