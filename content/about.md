My name is Terry (陈麟昊). I currently live in Evanston, studying Computer Science at Northwestern. I enjoy observing and learning about the strange quirks that make us human. I like building things, with focuses in content understanding & generation with agentic workflows. Previously, I have worked in product and engineering at TikTok and ByteDance. In my free time, I play tennis (occassionally soccer?) and go on random walks along the lakefill. I'm still figuring out life, so I'll spare you the formal introduction. If your in town, let's grab coffee, if not, zoom works just as well.
