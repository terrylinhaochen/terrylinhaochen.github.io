I made money in crypto. Decent money — exited with 50%+ returns on positions across BTC, ETH, COIN, and a few others. I'm not complaining.

But here's the thing I can't shake: I still don't understand how any of it is valued.

With equities, I have a framework. Messy, imperfect, full of assumptions — but a framework. Cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, comps. I can build a model and argue with it. I can be wrong in a specific, falsifiable way. With crypto, I genuinely cannot tell you what the "right" price for Bitcoin is, or Ethereum, or anything else in the space. I've read the arguments: store of value, digital gold, programmable money, settlement layer, inflation hedge. None of them give me a number I can defend. None of them let me say: at this price it's cheap, at that price it's expensive.

What I actually did was buy things that were going up, hold them until I felt nervous, and sell. That's not investing. That's momentum trading with extra steps and a lot of ideological dressing on top.

I'm not saying crypto is worthless. I'm saying I don't know how to figure out what it's worth — and I'm not convinced most people holding it do either. The ones who made real money either got in early enough that it didn't matter, or they're traders who don't pretend it's something else.

I exited. I took the gains. And I'll probably stay out until I can answer the valuation question honestly. I've been waiting a few years. Still waiting.
