## Semantic Retrieval vs. Traditional Search

![Semantic Retrieval Explanation](/images/posts/ai-search-topic-modeling/semantic-retrieval-explanation.png)
*Understanding the fundamental difference between semantic retrieval systems and traditional web crawlers: Exa operates as a semantic retrieval index over a pre-crawled corpus, focusing on high-quality, text-rich pages suitable for LLM context windows rather than real-time web crawling.*

## Modern Web Crawling Challenges

![Crawler Restrictions and Challenges](/images/posts/ai-search-topic-modeling/crawler-restrictions-challenges.png)
*The evolving landscape of web access restrictions: Modern platforms like Reddit, Xueqiu, and others implement sophisticated barriers to automated crawling, fundamentally changing how AI systems can access and index web content.*
