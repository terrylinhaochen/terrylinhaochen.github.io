Most APM advice focuses on how to sound like a product manager. But sounding right has never built a great product. What matters is developing the ability to be directionally right about the future — and proving it with metrics.

The best product thinkers I’ve learned from aren’t impressive because of their frameworks or polished answers. They stand out because they form falsifiable beliefs about how the world works: what users will care about, which constraints will dominate, where value will actually accumulate. Their predictions can be wrong, which means their thinking can be evaluated. That’s the only way judgment gets sharper.

APM interviews try to measure this, but their structure often selects for the opposite: well-rehearsed narratives, tidy templates, and answers optimized to look competent rather than expose real reasoning. It’s a performance loop. You can get very good at it without ever putting your thinking at risk or checking whether your instincts survive contact with user behavior.

The alternative is harder but more meaningful: build habits of thought that force you to take real positions, specify what would disprove them, and design metrics that reveal whether you’re actually right.

## Understanding the APM Role

Associate Product Manager positions are designed for early-career professionals transitioning into product management. Unlike senior PM roles that require deep domain expertise, APM interviews focus on potential, learning agility, and foundational thinking skills.

Key responsibilities typically include supporting product strategy development, where you'll contribute to high-level product decisions and roadmap planning. You'll spend significant time conducting user research and analysis to understand customer needs and behaviors. Writing product requirements and specifications forms a core part of the role, as does collaborating closely with engineering, design, and business teams to ensure successful product delivery. Additionally, you'll be responsible for analyzing product metrics and user feedback to inform future product iterations and improvements.

## Types of PM Interview Questions

PM interviews vary from company to company, but regardless of where you interview you're likely to run into questions that test your ability to design products, solve ambiguous problems, build effective strategies, and analyze and execute with data.

You'll also likely face questions like "Tell me about yourself" or "What's your favorite product?" With these, interviewers aim to get to know you as a product manager, and how you'd fit in with the company culture.

## Core Interview Categories

### 1. Product Design Questions

Product design questions ask you to design or improve a product. Common question types include designing a product from scratch, such as "Design an app for job-seekers to match with employers." You might also encounter improvement questions like "Improve headspace," where you need to identify pain points and propose enhancements to existing products. Another category focuses on designing for specific audiences, such as "Design a vending machine for the blind," which tests your ability to consider unique user constraints and accessibility needs. Finally, there are "moonshot" questions, particularly favored at Google, that ask you to "Design X, assuming you have infinite resources," allowing you to think beyond typical constraints.

Overall, your goal is to come up with a feasible product given the constraints of the question. Feasible, in this context, means that your product solves a problem in a way that makes sense for the company and that users will like.

These typically take 25 minutes excluding follow-ups. Interviewers like to ask product design questions early on to filter out candidates who don't have essential product skills, but they're a popular question type during on-site interviews as well. Expect to answer several in a standard PM interview loop.

#### A Framework for Answering Product Design Questions

A solid process is to first clarify the problem, gather relevant context until you understand users and their challenges, explore and select the best option, and finally, justify your answer. Follow this 7-step process:

1. **Clarify and get context**
2. **Define users**
3. **Identify pain points and opportunity areas**
4. **Brainstorm possible solutions**
5. **Define a product vision**
6. **Prioritize features**
7. **Evaluate and recap**

Let's work through an example to illustrate. Assume you've been asked the question "Design a better gym experience."

#### Step 1: Clarify and Get Context

First, clarify any vagueness about the problem you've been given. After you've clarified ambiguous company names and keywords, gather context that will help you understand the problem space and define any strategic considerations that might influence your design.

Questions like "What's the timeline?" or "Are there any constraints I should be aware of?" are fair game, but be prepared for an interviewer to give you a vague answer. In this case, make assumptions and state them to your interviewer so they have a chance to correct you if you're veering off-track.

**Example:** For our example question "Design a better gym experience" you'd want to ask a few questions to clarify the scope of the problem. Start by understanding what they mean by "gym experience" and what constitutes "better" in this context, including whether there are specific metrics you should focus on driving. Clarify the scope by asking whether you're improving a home gym product or a commercial gym setting. Determine if you're working on one particular gym location or designing improvements for an entire chain. Finally, establish whether you should focus on a specific gym brand like Planet Fitness or propose general improvements that could apply broadly.

Let's assume your interviewer doesn't offer much detail. They say: "Make whatever assumptions you like; we just know that the gym experience works for some and not others and we want to make it better for more users."

You state to your interviewer that, going forward, you'll answer the question assuming you're improving a generic commercial gym.

#### Step 2: Define Users

Next, define subsets of users that would effectively partition the total user base and pick an interesting subset for a deep dive. There are many ways to segment users. To get started, you could consider demographics like age or income level, which help you understand who your users are. You might also look at behavioral characteristics like frequency of use or users taking certain target actions, which reveal how people interact with your product. Geographic location can also be a meaningful segmentation approach, especially when regional preferences or constraints affect user behavior.

Any of these is a good jumping-off point, but a great answer segments users in a way that is meaningful for the question at hand. One helpful tip is to segment users who might have very different needs. After choosing a segmentation scheme and listing a few basic user subsets, pick a segment that interests you and articulate why that segment is valuable to discuss. Consider user subsets that may be strategic, such as early adopters who can drive product adoption and provide valuable feedback. Think about the scale of impact or the depth of pain that users feel, as addressing high-pain segments can create significant value. Also evaluate how well you or your company can address these users in the context of your question, ensuring your solution is realistic and achievable.

**Example:** Let's say you decide to segment users according to their usage of the gym. Sample segments might include "pro" users who frequent the gym regularly and have established workout routines, novice users who are new to fitness and may feel intimidated or unsure about equipment, users who primarily attend group classes and rarely use individual equipment, and users who maintain memberships but rarely or never actually visit the gym.

Let's say you want to target absent gym members:

"From this list, users who have memberships but don't go to the gym stand out as a good segment for a deeper dive because they're obviously experiencing an obstacle to achieving a goal. They were motivated enough to join the gym and are spending money on a membership, but something is preventing them from going. As an added benefit, I suspect we might be able to create value for other gym-goers and even attract new gym members if we solve this issue."

#### Step 3: Identify Pain Points and Opportunity Areas

Next, consider any goals your users might have. Any explicit obstacles are pain points. If nothing's blocking users from achieving their goals but some point of friction clearly exists, you've uncovered an opportunity area. Take an empathetic position and focus on how to best serve these users and you will uncover both.

Take a moment to summarize the goals you think your user subset has, then brainstorm pain points and opportunity areas preventing them from achieving those goals.

**Tip:** Use the "broad then deep" mini-framework to quickly hone in on key pain points.

Consider the circumstances users are in. Is the goal urgent? Are the decisions involved important or trivial? Asking yourself these questions and putting yourself in the user's shoes demonstrates user empathy, a key PM skill, so be sure to articulate your thought process to your interviewer.

**Example:** Returning to our gym example, it's clear that absent gym members had certain goals in mind when they bought their gym memberships. Their goals likely include some mix of the following:

- Getting healthier
- Looking better
- Gaining confidence
- Making friends (or at least being social)

What's stopping these users from following through on these goals and using the gym? Your brainstorm could include emotional components like feeling uncomfortable at the gym. Discomfort might have many dimensions, including feeling intimidated or feeling bored.

Thinking about their circumstances, you realize that going to the gym is a decision they're making from somewhere else - likely work or their homes. That creates logistical hurdles such as:

- Busy schedules
- Traffic
- A gym location that might not be convenient

Let's say you decide to address the emotional hurdles rather than logistical hurdles as logistics will be more specific to each user and harder to solve:

"Users might not be going to the gym because they feel uncomfortable. Gyms can feel sterile and intimidating, which could prevent users who want to gain confidence or be social from using the gym. Gyms can also be boring, especially during peak times when users vie for limited equipment and might have to wait around awkwardly between sets.

It's possible that users face a combination of emotional hurdles like feeling bored at the gym, and logistical issues, like a busy schedule, which would make it hard to decide to get to the gym after a busy or stressful day. If we can make the gym more compelling by solving the boredom or intimidation issue, the decision to go should be easier for my target users.

Going forward, I'd like to address the boredom issue at the gym. Specifically, the problem of waiting around for popular equipment to open up."

#### Step 4: Brainstorm Possible Solutions

Now, brainstorm ideas that could solve the pain point you've identified.

**Tip:** One helpful tip for coming up with solutions is to think of products you like — especially anything solving a similar problem in another context. For example, Duolingo might be a good analogue for our gym example as it effectively removes barriers for people who want to improve themselves (by learning a language) but who have trouble with motivation, routine, or planning. The app is fun, easy to use, and the emphasis is on consistency rather than intensity. These are all characteristics you might incorporate into your design.

Aim to generate at least three solid ideas before moving on to the next step. It's fine to brainstorm a bigger list and eliminate weak ideas. Check each idea against the pain point you identified and don't be afraid to get creative. Interviewers want to see excitement and passion for product.

**Example:** Continuing our gym example, recall that you've decided to address the pain point of users feeling bored at the gym, especially during peak hours as users wait for equipment. Your brainstorm of possible solutions could include making the gym experience more customized through a workout recommendation system that accounts for peak hours, suggesting alternative exercises when popular equipment is unavailable. Another approach might involve "gamifying" the gym experience so users feel more engaged at the gym overall, perhaps through challenges, achievements, or social features. You could also consider creating a specific activity to fill the time between sets, helping users feel more engaged while waiting rather than standing around awkwardly.

#### Step 5: Come Up with a Forward-Looking Product Vision

Pick the strongest solution from the previous section and take a moment or two to envision what that product will look like in five or ten years. Come up with a brief tagline that really emphasizes the point you're making. You want to leave the interviewer with a soundbite they'll remember when they're scoring your interview. Write it on the whiteboard (if you're using one) and refer back to it as you continue.

**Example:** Continuing our gym example, a forward-looking vision might look like this:

"A visit to the gym is made up of more than just the active time of working out, and that non-active time is often awkward or boring. In a futuristic gym, that time could be fun and exciting."

That could be enough for a short-and-sweet product vision, but if you want to add a bit more detail, you could finish with:

"Let's build a gym that offers engaging activities available in between sets, helping users stay in the right mindset while getting a more effective workout."

#### Step 6: Prioritize Features

Once you've crafted a compelling product vision, it's time to prioritize features.

We recommend walking the interviewer through a quick user journey where a user interacts with your product. This will help you concretely identify how your product fits into the existing user flow which will help you prioritize features. It'll also help you stay user-centric instead of over-defining an idea that appeals to you personally.

Then, brainstorm a short list of features based on your use case(s) and prioritize according to which features best support your product vision. Be sure to tie the discussion back to user pain points. Here are a few helpful dimensions to consider when evaluating features: scale, which measures how many users this feature will help and the breadth of its impact; ease of expansion, which considers how easily this feature will expand to other user subsets and whether it will attract new users to the platform; and strategic impact, which evaluates how well this feature supports the company vision and broader business objectives.

You don't need to describe every part of the feature in detail, but interviewers do expect you to describe what the user sees and interacts with and how that delivers on the product goals and vision you defined.

**Example:** For our gym example, recall your product vision:

"Let's build a gym that has supporting activities available in between sets, helping users stay in the right mindset and have more effective workouts."

To begin prioritizing features, you might describe different specific approaches to supporting user's workouts. As you decided to focus on the problem of boredom between sets, it's worth detailing that experience in a bit more detail. Ask yourself "What's the process of waiting?"

"If you (a user) are standing around waiting, you're typically either waiting to use a machine or taking a break between sets. We only have a small window; maybe five to ten minutes where we want to keep you engaged and entertained, but not distracted from your workout. Therefore our product should be a short experience that improves the user's workout. For instance, we could create an app to log workouts and provide users with stats tracking, workout journal prompts, or tips and recommendations for their next set."

#### Step 7: Evaluate and Recap

As you wrap up, summarize your insights and your overall design for your interviewer, then spend a few minutes evaluating your design and discussing next steps. Consider:

- Tradeoffs you made
- Alternate use cases and edge cases
- What you'd do differently given more time

Common follow-up questions from interviewers include: "Can you see any risks with this design?" and "What challenges do you anticipate in implementing this product?" Discussing risks and challenges preemptively signals to interviewers that your ideas are grounded in reality.

**Example:** To close the example question:

"One risk we should consider is that gyms are busy places with heavy equipment, so it could be dangerous if people are too distracted. We'd also have to make sure this doesn't slow down users' workouts or create more bottlenecks."

#### Tips for Answering Product Design Questions

**Consider Company Strategy**

Bringing strategic concerns into the mix can help you reach a broader and deeper understanding of the problem at hand. Here are some prompts to consider:

- **Company mission**: What's the company mission? Why does the company care about this space? How could this product support the mission?
- **Company strategy**: What are the relevant strategic goals the company might have? How could this tie into those or open up a new strategy? What products make sense strategically?
- **Market understanding**: What alternatives already exist in the market? Where are the gaps? What's valuable in this market?

**Ace Moonshot Questions by Abstracting the Problem**

Moonshots are bold ideas that go beyond incremental changes. They're frequently associated with Google interviews, but you can "moonshot" any design question by digging deep until you've uncovered the root of an important problem in a way that feels transformative.

You're on the right track if you've found a way to solve the problem completely and simply for the user. If you're able to eliminate the conditions that cause the problem in the first place, even better.

We've found two different strategies helpful for candidates practicing moonshots. One is to think of the product as a black box. The input is the user's current state, and the output is the user as they want to be. By eliminating all assumptions about how to get users from where they are to where they want to be and exploring what could happen in that space, really transformative solutions can sometimes become clear.

Another strategy is to use something like the 5 Whys technique to dig deeper and deeper until you uncover the root of the problem.

You could also consider what the user's actual goals are. For instance, if you're asked to build an alarm clock for deaf users, consider that the user's goal is to wake up at a certain time. Rather than limiting yourself to modifying how existing alarm clocks work, this framing allows for new options that rethink what an alarm clock is. Our best advice is to focus on the user and their needs — this approach will never steer you wrong.

**Consider Existing Users, Strategic Goals, and Market Context When Answering Product Improvement Questions**

Sometimes, you'll be asked to improve an existing product. Questions like "Improve Instagram's home tab" are similar to "design X" questions, but you'll have to consider established users, goals, and market dynamics. Keep these in mind, and consider addressing under-served users, supporting new use cases, or adapting a product to open new strategic opportunities - these are all common areas for improvement.

#### Common Product Design Pitfalls

The first major pitfall is jumping straight to a solution without explaining your thought process. Make sure you walk the interviewer through how you think and why your idea is a good solution. Don't decide on a solution immediately after hearing the question, and keep an open mind because you'll usually find better ideas as you explore the problem space.

Another common mistake is forgetting to segment users, even when you think you've been given a specific user group. For instance, if you were asked "Design Gmail for kids," you might assume kids are already a narrow segment. However, kids are still a broad group, and you could segment further by age range or school level to focus your design more effectively.

A related pitfall is trying to design for everybody, which usually results in a product that nobody actually cares about. If you don't narrow your scope appropriately, you'll struggle to gain meaningful insights about your users and their specific pain points.

Finally, avoid simply checking off the boxes of a framework. While it's helpful to use a framework to stay on track, the steps are recommendations to help you find insights, not a rigid checklist you must complete. Make sure you consider your answer holistically at every stage rather than mechanically moving through steps.

### How to Brainstorm Product Ideas

Many PM product interview questions boil down to "What is the future of X?" X might be an industry, such as wearables, a location, such as airports, or even a non-tech product, like a wrench.

The purpose of this question is to test your ability to identify and communicate an inspiring-yet-actionable product vision.

"Future of X" questions are some of the most fun interview questions, though they can pose challenges. Similar to behavioral questions, it's easy to ramble. Applying a structured approach can help you bound your thinking effectively while still sharing your passion and vision.

We have two key recommendations to keep you on track:

1. Remember to apply your product thinking skills to these questions. Whatever your bold vision for the future is, make sure it satisfies a real and important need. Articulate the details and continuously tie your answer back to that need.

2. Before the interview, curate a "big ideas" list of all the technologies, trends, and concepts that excite you. This list should be big enough in scope that no matter what "future of X" question you get, you can pull something from your list to speak intelligently about. This will prevent you from rambling or pigeonholing yourself into an idea that doesn't feel exciting to you.

Here's a simple process for answering the "future of X" question using the big ideas list:

#### Step 1: Build a "Big Ideas" List

Before your interviews, put together a "big ideas" list — a roster of interesting ideas that you're passionate about and familiar with. Start by brainstorming a list of all your favorite trends and technologies that might lead to a radically different future.

Some interesting trend ideas might include decentralized finance, the circular economy, or cooperatively owned digital platforms. The technologies you list can be anything that inspires you — examples include blockchain, quantum computing, nanotech, etc. For inspiration, we recommend browsing the news in science or tech or watching/reading science fiction. Let your imagination wander.

Pick three to five of your favorite ideas and really study them.

Make sure you know the arguments for and against any existing technologies in your chosen areas, as well as the go-to-market strategies for any major startups operating in these spaces. Familiarize yourself with popular industry figures who are driving innovation and discourse. Additionally, stay informed about ongoing political discussions that might impact your ideas, such as regulatory debates around privacy, antitrust, or emerging technology governance.

Having done the legwork beforehand, you won't waste time second-guessing yourself during your interview.

#### Step 2: Combine Product Thinking with an Appropriate "Big Idea"

Once you're given the question, begin deploying your usual product thinking approach to understand the product/company/industry goals and users of X. Questions to ask yourself include how you might segment users to better understand their diverse needs and behaviors, what their key pain points are and what challenges they face with current solutions, what characteristics define the product, company, or industry you're analyzing, and what constraints exist today and how those limitations might evolve or be overcome in the future.

At the same time, map items in your big ideas list to the space, and choose the most appropriate to apply X. You might choose one big idea, or combine a few for a really original take — this is up to you.

#### Step 3: Critically Answer the Question

Take the pain points or new opportunities you've identified and think critically about how some of your big ideas could solve them. Take some time to quietly imagine how this product will fit into the future 10, 20, or 30 years down the line. When you're ready, begin outlining your vision for your interviewer.

A simple process for arriving at a compelling answer is:

1. Summarize big idea(s) and briefly state why you think they will revolutionize X in terms of relevant product/company/industry goals and users.
2. Walk the interviewer through the existing user journey, calling out any user pain points or opportunity areas.
3. Paint a picture of the future user journey with your big idea(s) incorporated.
4. Cite important risks and mitigation strategies as well as any tradeoffs.

Remember to apply critical thinking skills throughout. It's easy to get swept away in the romance of your vision, but there are always risks and tradeoffs to consider. This is where all the research you did in building your big ideas list will help. Being able to cite arguments against something you believe in shows maturity and the ability to handle complexity.

#### Example: "What is the Future of Libraries?"

Let's say your interviewer asks a question that boils down to "What is the future of libraries?" They may actually ask you "How will we consume books in the future?" or "How would you improve the library system?" These are essentially the same questions, and you can use the same approach to answer all three.

Assume your big ideas list includes both context-awareness and the sharing economy and you want to apply both to answer the future of libraries question.

**The Future of Libraries Including Context Awareness**

First, you'd summarize your first big idea and walk through the existing user journey:

"Context awareness, or the ability of technology to understand a user's context and alter its services accordingly, will radically change the future, especially libraries. Currently, when a 'user' walks into a library, they have to search the catalog for desired books, often failing to find the thing they need, or missing an opportunity to find a book they would have loved."

Next, you'd paint a vivid picture of an improved user journey, thanks to your big idea:

"Imagine a future where, when users walk into a library, they'll be able to scan a unique user-identification barcode at a terminal, which will allow the library to recommend exactly what they should read. This might be based on schooling, current interests, and possibly even browser history (if users opt-in.) The library can then personalize its information to match user interests, instead of surfacing, say, a bunch of advanced accounting books the user has absolutely no interest in."

Finally, you'd cite risks and tradeoffs:

"Of course, libraries are also about exploration. The algorithms that suggest content should still suggest fresh, new information. There are some big risks here with user privacy and model training which we should make sure to address..."

**The Future of Libraries Including the Sharing Economy**

Your interviewer might press you for another idea, or you might want to cover another idea you're passionate about, say, the sharing economy:

"Another important way I believe libraries will evolve will include the principles of the sharing economy; a community-based 'peer-to-peer' approach to distributing goods and services. Specifically where libraries are concerned, there is an incredible number of physical books sitting in people's houses. There's huge untapped potential here for increased personal interactions, increased access to books, especially niche books that a typical library might not carry, and more sustainable processes for book storage and transportation."

Next, you'd paint a picture of the new and improved future:

"In the future, the sharing economy will help us share not just our homes or our cars, but also our personal possessions, like books. Imagine a future where, if you want a book that's unavailable at your library, you can instead exchange books with your neighbor, who has a copy. This 'decentralized library system' will create tons of new social connections across communities."

Finally, to cover tradeoffs:

"One issue with this, however, is that cataloging all these books will be hard work. Advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology that can turn images into machine-readable text may be able to help with this. For example, if a user takes a picture of their bookshelf and all of their books get cataloged for them, that's significantly less work. The technology isn't quite there yet though..."

### 2. Product Strategy Questions

Product strategy questions focus on your ability to develop a long-term product plan that aligns with the company strategy. There are many common variants of strategy questions that assess your ability to build go-to-market (GTM) or pricing strategies, assess options for market entry, or monetize an existing product.

Your interviewer will evaluate your understanding of key product strategy concepts, such as:

- Market identification and competitive analysis
- Product road mapping, product positioning, and product pricing strategy
- Measuring product success

**Examples of product strategy questions:** You might be asked whether Amazon should enter the food delivery business, which would test your ability to analyze market opportunities and competitive positioning. Another common question asks what the biggest threat to YouTube is, requiring you to think about industry dynamics and competitive landscape. You could also face pricing questions like being asked to price a new line of high-end mineral water bottles for the US market as a PM at a beverage company.

**Basic Framework:**
1. **Market analysis** - Size, growth, competitive landscape
2. **Company fit** - Core competencies, strategic alignment, resources
3. **Barriers and risks** - What could go wrong? How significant?
4. **Success requirements** - What would need to be true for this to work?
5. **Recommendation** - Clear yes/no with reasoning

## How to Answer Strategy Questions

Strategy interviews typically range from 40 minutes to an hour. A good answer builds to a logically defensible strategy that you can summarize in a few sentences, but a great answer includes more than a solid strategy. Aim to come to an incisive understanding of the landscape, synthesizing your exploration into new insights. These insights will be the basis of your strategy, but they should also open up future possibilities.

You also want to save a few minutes to discuss what you'd do differently given more information, discuss risk mitigation strategies, or describe how your long-term vision would evolve.

The thought of doing all that in 40 minutes may be intimidating, but remember that interviewers care more about your process than your final answer.

### 7-Step Framework for Product Strategy Questions

Note that under this framework, you won't start generating options until step 5. This is key. It's impossible to make good decisions without understanding the task at hand (clarifying the problem), where you are (defining the landscape), and where you're trying to go (product/company/industry goals.) We recommend you spend up to 50% of your time on steps 1 through 4.

**Step 1: Clarify the problem**
**Step 2: Define the product, company, or industry goals**
**Step 3: Define the landscape**
**Step 4: Define guiding principles**
**Step 5: Establish an option set**
**Step 6: Make your decision and argue for it**
**Step 7: Evaluate and recap**

Let's work through an example. Assume you've been asked "What's the biggest threat to YouTube over the next 5 years?"

#### Step 1: Clarify the Problem

First, take time to clarify the problem and check any assumptions. This ensures that you and the interviewer are on the same page and you're addressing the proper scope. Asking good questions also shows your interviewer that you have a sense for important information that might be missing and that you know to ask for it, rather than making assumptions.

Start by scoping out each component of the question. Look for company names, nouns, and verbs. For example, "Should Amazon start selling live plants?" breaks down to a few key components that need clarification. First, when you say Amazon, do you mean Amazon online, or can you consider Amazon-owned brick and mortar entities like Whole Foods? Second, by selling, do you mean Amazon would sell directly, or could you consider facilitating third-party sales? Finally, by live plants, what's in scope—individual potted plants, trays of seedlings, or even whole trees?

Anything that you find helpful to making sense of the problem is fair game. Specifically, you want to clarify any vagueness in the question, ask about constraints that might affect your analysis, and simply state important assumptions you're making so the interviewer has a chance to correct you if you're veering off track.

**Example:** For our YouTube question, you might ask whether we mean YouTube as a company or just the core YouTube product, and whether we're considering threats globally or just in the US.

Let's assume the interviewer confirms that we're talking about the whole company when we say YouTube, not just the core product, and that we're considering threats globally.

#### Step 2: Define the Product, Company, or Industry Goals

Once you've scoped the problem, you're ready to begin defining important goals. The key is to land on a clear and concise sense of what matters most to the entity that you're strategizing for, whether it be a product, a company, or an industry. You probably won't know the real product/company/industry goals off-hand, so you'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on the product portfolio, company mission, or other facts you might know. List those assumptions for your interviewer, as well as any relevant:

- Key business value-drivers
- Existing strategies  
- Specific strengths and weaknesses

**Tip:** If you're new to this, we recommend familiarizing yourself with classic strategic analysis frameworks like value chain analysis. This will help you move through Step 2 faster.

**Example:** For our YouTube question, consider how YouTube's business works and what's most important to it.

Start by making some reasonable assumptions:

"YouTube's most important product is its core product, the YouTube video platform. It drives most of YouTube's revenue. Though they have other initiatives like Music and TV, over the 5-year time frame, this will be the primary driver of success.

YouTube's primary metric is watch time. Their business model is primarily based on ad revenue, though there are some alternative monetization schemes. YouTube's most important goal is to increase watch time.

At the heart of watch time is the relationship between viewers and creators. Creators post on the platform to reach an audience and make money. Viewers come to watch videos made by creators. Advertisers display ads to these viewers, creating revenue for YouTube and creators. This is a strong, positive cycle, and supporting it is critical for YouTube."

**Based on the above analysis, your takeaway would be:**
YouTube's most important goal is to drive up watch time by maintaining a strong relationship between creators and viewers.

#### Step 3: Define the Landscape

Next, consider outside influences that may affect your strategic decision. Two key questions to ask yourself include what aspects of the landscape will influence your options and ultimately your decision, and what opportunities or challenges you might reasonably expect to face.

Here are a few of the most common factors to consider when defining the landscape. First, examine market and competition dynamics—is the market unusually competitive, are there entrenched players dominating the market, and what are key competitors doing? Second, assess public opinion and cultural climate—what does public sentiment look like, is the environment welcoming of your product, company, or industry, and how will users and the broader public react to change? Third, analyze technology factors—what technologies already exist, what new technologies are emerging, and what kind of technological barriers to entry exist? Finally, consider regulation—how might relevant governments react to change, what existing regulation should you watch out for, and how stable is the overall regulatory environment?

Use your judgment as a PM to select the dimensions that are most relevant to your question. Be sure to leverage all the work you did defining company goals. It's easy to get lost mapping the landscape–everything seems relevant at first, but anchoring on goals will help you quickly discern the context that matters.

**Example:** For our YouTube question, given that the relationship between creators and viewers is critical, you might decide to focus on threats in terms of what could disrupt that relationship:

"A key company goal for YouTube is nurturing the relationship between creators and viewers. If we consider big threats to be those that threaten this relationship, I see two main categories:

1. The most obvious are direct competitors who convince creators to post on their platforms instead of YouTube. They could do this by making it easier to create and reach an audience or by offering more money. TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat could all fit the bill.

2. From the viewer side, anything that pulls viewers away also weakens this relationship. The same competitors are relevant, but so are indirect competitors; platforms that pull away time from our users. For example, Netflix and other streaming platforms, Roblox, Minecraft, Twitch, and Twitter.

On the plus side, YouTube has a strong brand and is seen as a go-to platform for user-generated video content."

#### Step 4: Define Guiding Principles

Your landscape analysis coupled with the goals you defined in step 2 will allow you to converge on a set of guiding principles that will help you build your option set and eventually make your strategic decision.

Guiding principles, in this context, are a snapshot view of the situation that captures business rationale and allows for consistent decision-making without second-guessing priorities.

**Example:** For our YouTube example, given the goals and threats identified, you might decide on these guiding principles:

1. YouTube cares most about watch time
2. The biggest concern, then, is what could disrupt viewers and/or creators - especially the relationship between the two  
3. Competitors that can effectively draw the attention of both creators and viewers are an outsized threat to YouTube's business

#### Step 5: Establish an Option Set

Now that you have defined relevant context and established guiding principles, you can finally begin brainstorming strategic options and ranking how well they fit against your principles and goals.

You probably have a few options in mind already. Write them down first then return to the original question to come up with more. Your brainstorm will depend on the specifics of the question.

Then, based on your guiding principles and the context you've built so far, filter out any weak options so you can focus on the most important. Be sure to explain why you remove each option so your interviewer can track your logic.

**Example:** For our YouTube question, your option set would probably include direct competitors which host user-generated video content that lures both creators and viewers away, such as:
- TikTok
- Instagram  
- Snapchat
- Twitch

You might also include indirect competitors that pull viewers away from YouTube without specifically targeting creators, such as:
- Netflix
- Twitter

Based on our guiding principles, which emphasize the relationship between creators and viewers, you decide to eliminate indirect competitors from the option set, as they don't explicitly target creators and thus don't pose as big a threat to the creator-viewer relationship.

#### Step 6: Make Your Decision and Argue for It

Similar to filtering out weak options, making your final decision means referring back to your guiding principles and goals to pick the strongest option. You'll likely have to decide between multiple good options, so you'll need to clearly justify your choice. There are many factors to consider when making final strategic decisions. Depending on the question, you might consider:

- Scale
- Impact  
- Cost
- Risk(s)
- Likelihood of success
- Additional benefits (like partnerships or product synergies)

**Example:** For our YouTube question, let's say you conclude that TikTok is the biggest threat:

"Let's consider TikTok to be the biggest threat to YouTube. Though all three of my final options (TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat) could pull users and creators away from YouTube, TikTok has the clearest success so far and is growing rapidly, particularly in a popular form of video (short-form) that YouTube hasn't quite cracked yet.

TikTok has made it easy for creators to post and build an audience, making their platform an attractive place to start as a new creator or move to as an existing one. Short-form video is extremely popular with viewers and the experience is very sticky, pulling viewers away from spending time on YouTube. TikTok also does well with an important demographic of younger users, who are critical for the short- and long-term success of YouTube."

#### Step 7: Evaluate and Recap

As a last step, evaluate and recap the work you've done above. To preempt follow-up questions, it's a good idea to:

- Discuss tradeoffs
- Share what you'd do differently if you had more time
- Summarize how you'd mitigate potential risks  
- Emphasize why your choice sets up the company for success

**Example:** As we close our example, you could include something like this in your evaluation:

"If I had more time, I'd like to have explored the implications of acting on TikTok as the main threat. For instance, TikTok users skew younger than the average YouTube user. If we're not careful, we might make strategic choices that prioritize YouTube's younger audience to the detriment of its older core users.

Overall, YouTube has a solid hold on core users and their use case, so as long as we don't harm their experience with any competitive move we'd make to address TikTok, we'll likely be able to maintain our competitive edge.

I'd also like to do more research. This has all been based on intuition and assumption, so while I'd want to confirm all of my assumptions, the key assumption I'd need to look into is how creators really feel, both those on YouTube, and those who have chosen other platforms, before I could give a definitive answer as to whether the TikTok threat is as big as I'm assuming."

### Common Strategy Question Pitfalls

- **Set context.** Don't just jump to an answer. Your interviewer wants to see your ability to make sense of the situation and justify your decisions.
- **Structure your answer.** Whether you use this framework or create your own, there's a lot to discuss. Having a clear structure can keep you on track and make your answer easier to follow.
- **Make sure to answer the question.** It's easy to get caught up laying out a bunch of strategic insights. Don't forget to drive towards an answer and turn these into a specific decision. Make clear choices, give details about your approach, and make it concrete.
- **Consider trade-offs.** Most strategies mean prioritizing one aspect to the detriment of another. Don't forget to explain what the trade-offs are and why you think they're reasonable (or when they wouldn't be).

Overall, remember that we recommend light use of frameworks. You don't want to sound robotic or force yourself down a single path too early. Use this framework as guidance as you start answering strategy questions, but work on developing your own intuition about how to structure your answers that builds on your unique strengths.

## How to Answer Go-to-Market Strategy Questions

Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy questions assess your ability to launch a product successfully. Example questions include:

- "How would you launch a new product recommendation carousel for Amazon?"
- "How would you launch a standalone Amazon restaurant food delivery app?"
- "Come up with a launch strategy for Google Glass"

In addition to standard strategy concerns such as company mission, product strategy, and landscape, examine your user base more carefully.

Ask yourself:
- Does the launch aim to increase engagement among existing users, or is the company targeting new users?
- How will I reach my target audience?
- How will I convince them the product is valuable?
- What additional resources and support will I need to execute the launch plan successfully?

All of these are valid paths to explore as you answer a GTM question.

### Step 1: Define the Landscape

At first, your approach will mirror the basic strategy question framework. You'll work to uncover the reason for the launch and in doing so, gain an understanding of target users, define a set of product goals, and consider the competitive landscape. Then, you'll define a reasonable GTM strategy to support those goals.

When asking clarifying questions, be sure to ask your interviewer for clarification on:
- What the product does
- How it sits in the company's product portfolio
- Why the product is being launched

Ask yourself "What is this company seeking to do as a business, and with this product specifically?" Any feature, product, and company strategies you discuss should align. For example, if you've been asked to launch a new feature, consider how the feature serves to accomplish product goals. If you've been asked to launch a new product, consider how the product serves to accomplish company goals.

Before jumping into GTM considerations, consider the competitive landscape at hand. As in general product strategy questions, ask yourself:
- What aspects of the landscape will influence the company's options, and ultimately its decision?
- What opportunities or challenges might I reasonably expect to face?

### Step 2: Identify a GTM Strategy

Go-to-market strategies vary widely from company to company. Your answer will depend on the specifics of the scenario you're given, but it can be helpful to read about other companies' GTM strategies to get a sense of what's possible. For example:

- **Inbound GTM strategy**: A company creates helpful content to attract the attention of its target audience
- **Sales-driven GTM strategy**: Empowers highly trained and often technical salespeople to sell complicated products with long sales cycles
- **Demand generation GTM strategy**: Aims to create audience demand by generating buzz around the launch

As you begin the GTM portion of the question, define the subset of users who will need to see, trust, and ultimately buy into the new product or feature. Follow this two-phased approach:

**Phase 1**: Identify a user segment you want to acquire, and find ways to reach them.
**Phase 2**: Brainstorm how to convince those users to first try the product, and ultimately stick with it.

Finally, prioritize the approach that makes the most sense and briefly discuss how you'd execute. You can return to the standard framework for this piece.

### GTM Example: Spotify Podcast Launch

Let's work through an example: "As the PM launching Spotify's Podcast product, how would you acquire users?"

#### Clarifying Questions
First, ask clarifying questions such as:
- "Do we already have a catalog of podcasts?"
- "Will this product exist inside the Spotify app, or will it be a standalone offering?"

Assume your interviewer gives you the following details:
- We do have a catalog of podcasts. We will offer the most widely distributed podcasts, and we have a few exclusive deals with big names.
- The podcast product will exist inside the Spotify app. There will be a podcast tab and podcast content will be listed on the homepage.

#### Define Business and Product Goals

A GTM question essentially asks how you'd acquire (the right) users for a new feature or product, so you'd want to consider why Spotify wants to acquire users before proceeding. Explore the business and product goals:

"Let's talk about Spotify as a business and what podcasts offer. Spotify's business is based on a tiered model, where premium users pay a subscription and free users listen to ads. Spotify wants both types of users to spend time listening so they choose to pay for a subscription or generate ad revenue.

Podcasts are a popular content type. They can cover a range of topics and they appeal to many different people. Many podcasts have avid followers, and most release new episodes at a regular cadence. Also, podcasts are a different type of content than music, allowing Spotify to diversify."

From there, connect the dots. Summarize why launching a successful podcast product would be a win for Spotify:

"If Spotify offers a compelling podcast experience, it could convince existing free users to spend more time listening, possibly even sign up for Premium features, increasing the Lifetime value (LTV) of our customers. Podcasts could also make Spotify attractive to new types of users, for example, podcast fans who weren't interested in the music catalog."

#### Analyze Competitive Landscape

Before jumping into GTM options, consider the competitive landscape:

"Podcast services are a crowded space and it's easy to enter with the widely available catalog of content. While users may be loyal to a particular podcast, they probably don't care what app they use to listen to as long as they like the UI. This could make it easier to acquire a user, but also easier to lose them. There may also be some inertia in getting a user to change their listening habit. The most notable differentiation is that some services have exclusive podcasts, and it sounds like Spotify will also have some."

#### Define Target User Segment

Use your judgment as a PM to choose a product goal and user segment that are compelling. For this example:

"I'm going to assume that the primary goal is to convert existing Spotify users, especially free users, into podcast listeners. This strategy makes it easier to get traction within the crowded podcast landscape, and there's a significant long-term benefit to retaining users for longer periods of time."

#### Phase 1: Reach Target Users

Now that you've laid out a product goal and a target user segment, and discussed the competitive landscape, it's time to identify GTM strategies.

"As I think about GTM strategies, initially reaching target users is going to be easy because our goal is to convert existing Spotify users. The most obvious way to reach them is through the homepage when they open the app. We have their user information and activity data stored in our database; we may even have product usage signals to tell us who'd be interested in podcasts. In a more general sense, we can identify places our users are likely to be – e.g. reaching out through targeted ads or partnerships with other products that our users also tend to use."

#### Phase 2: Convince Users to Try and Stick

"How we convince users to try Spotify Podcasts depends on the method we use to reach them. Convenience and exclusive content are likely to drive usage. If they're in the app, we might present a personalized recommendation for a podcast so they can see the value right away — and they're likely already intending to listen to something. If they're not already in the app, we could reach them through email, getting them excited about the content, or giving them a limited-time offer to try podcasts. We could also make exclusive deals with podcasters."

#### Prioritize GTM Strategy

As you wrap up the GTM discussion, prioritize a GTM strategy that makes sense given all your work up to this point:

"In this case, given the immediacy and the scale of users to reach, in-app promotion is the most effective. Next steps include adding podcast recommendations within the cards on the homepage, directing users to the Podcast tab, and perhaps making personalized playlists for users to check out."

#### Evaluate Strategy

Finally, finish with an evaluation of your strategy. What are the risks, challenges, and tradeoffs that could come with this strategy? What might you consider as the long-term approach?

"In the relatively near term, Spotify wants to acquire new users. The existing user base is helpful for that: Attract more exclusive deals on better terms because you can guarantee a big audience to bring in these podcast audiences. A notable challenge is that podcast users might not be inclined to subscribe to Premium because podcasts have ads burned into them already. You would need to invest in valuable Premium-only features, such as auto-download for offline listening (assuming these aren't widely available elsewhere)."

### GTM Strategy Framework Summary

1. **Define the landscape** - Understand product goals, competitive context, and strategic alignment
2. **Identify user segments** - Determine who you're trying to reach and why
3. **Phase 1: Reach users** - Find ways to get in front of your target audience
4. **Phase 2: Convert users** - Convince them to try and stick with the product
5. **Prioritize approach** - Choose the most effective strategy given your constraints
6. **Evaluate strategy** - Discuss risks, tradeoffs, and long-term considerations

## How to Answer Pricing Strategy Questions

Pricing strategy questions assess your ability to set a product price that makes sense in a given business context. Pricing is much more complex than just setting a number, and answering pricing questions well requires a firm understanding of how the product serves users and the core business. Example questions include:

- "How would you go about pricing a self-driving car?"
- "How would you price buying a season of a show?"
- "As a Google PM, what's the next piece of hardware you would launch, and how would you price it?"

To answer these, work through the general framework first, then consider the many ways product pricing can impact the success of a product and the larger company. For starters:

- **Price affects revenue and gross margin.** Generally, higher-priced products sell fewer units, but the gross margin on each unit is higher.
- **Different prices attract different user groups.** For example, luxury goods with sky-high prices attract users with certain characteristics in common.
- **Pricing affects how people perceive the product.** For example, consumers expect luxury brands to sell expensive products and they expect a quality product in return, whereas a mass-market product priced similarly might seem like a ripoff.

Keep these considerations in mind as you work to understand the problem context, the product and company goals, and the competitive landscape. Once you've covered those, you can hone in on a pricing strategy.

### Step 1: Define the Landscape

When asking clarifying questions, be sure to ask how the product offers value beyond the company's existing portfolio. Understanding new features or content offerings will help you discern who the target users are, which will help you set a reasonable pricing strategy.

You'll also want to ask questions to help you understand how the product will be launched - is it a brand-new offering, in which case you'll set the initial price? Or has there been a change that requires new pricing? If this is the case, you'll have to consider the existing pricing strategy and how it might make sense to diverge from it.

As you define product goals and company strategy, consider where the company is right now, and where it would like to go. For example:

- Is the company entering a new market? Seeking market dominance?
- Is the company seeking short-term profits or investing in a strategy for the long term?
- What about this product is novel, and how will offering this novelty affect the company's brand?
- What risks exist in moving ahead with this product?

Finally, consider landscape factors:

- **Competition**: Is the market highly competitive? Are there entrenched players? If so, is the company one of them?
- **Public opinion**: How will the public react to the product? Are there any regional factors to consider?
- **Internationalization**: How is the current pricing strategy applied in international markets (if any)? How relevant is the scalability of the pricing strategy to other geographies?
- **Consumer Price Sensitivity**: Is inflation affecting the market right now? What is current consumer price sensitivity?

All of these factors can potentially affect your pricing strategy, but the list is not exhaustive. Figure out what makes sense given the specifics of your question.

### Step 2: Identify a Pricing Strategy

After you've defined goals and landscape considerations, move on to pricing. Here are some common pricing strategies to be aware of:

- **Value-based pricing**: Set product price according to the value of the product as perceived by its users.
- **Cost-plus pricing**: One of the simplest pricing strategies. Simply apply a markup to production cost.
- **Dynamic pricing**: Instead of setting a price for an extended period of time, in some markets it makes sense to price products dynamically according to fluctuating demand. Surge pricing from rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft is an example.

Consider whether there is an existing strategy in place, in which case you'd likely adapt that to suit your product, or whether there is another benchmark price you can make use of. If you're pricing an entirely new product, you might use the cost-plus strategy taking into consideration the company's brand and the expected value of the product to users.

Then, consider the company's macro and micro goals - overall, what is the company mission? What is it trying to do in the space? And what is it trying to do with this product? Don't forget to consider how the product sits in the company's product portfolio. Sometimes a new offering will cannibalize existing products. Use your judgment as a PM to make a call.

**Tip**: You may have other insights personal to you. Studying behavioral economics might have given you insights into how to frame relative prices. Previous work experiences where you launched a substitute for an existing product may have given you a reference for answering pricing questions. Strategy questions are a great place to showcase your particular interests as a PM, so don't hold these back.

### Pricing Example: Uber Autonomous Vehicles

Let's work through an example: "Assume Uber is rolling out autonomous vehicles (AVs) in San Francisco. How would you price a ride for these vehicles?"

#### Clarifying Questions

First, ask clarifying questions. For the Uber question, you'd want to ask:
- "What's the performance (and regulatory status) of these vehicles?"
- "How many vehicles will Uber have? Will they all be deployed at once?"
- "Is this a separate service from UberX?"

You could ask your interviewer what Uber's goals are for launching these autonomous vehicles, but don't be surprised if the interviewer asks you to define that yourself. Let's assume your interviewer tells you that:
- The technology is approved by regulators
- Performance-wise, the AVs operate more safely than human drivers
- AVs will make up roughly 10% of the total fleet size at peak hours

#### Define Product Goals and Strategy

Next, define the product goals for the AV fleet, and Uber's overall strategy. It can be helpful to consider what's novel about the product:

"Releasing AVs will change Uber's operations significantly. AVs don't need drivers, so they can operate more frequently and don't need to be paid a wage — though there could be a rental fee if Uber doesn't own the vehicles. The lack-of-driver factor obviously lowers the cost of operating the vehicles. Also, AVs are a new technology, which is exciting and could strengthen Uber's brand as cutting-edge but could cause concern about drivers being replaced or about safety.

Overall, AVs are likely a significant investment. If deployed well, this would make Uber a leader in the space. Uber doesn't seem to be aiming for short-term profits with this launch. I'm going to assume, going forward, that Uber is seeking market dominance. In terms of product goals, AVs can support Uber's market domination goal by increasing vehicle availability while possibly reducing cost and by strengthening Uber's positioning as a tech leader."

#### Analyze Strategic Landscape

The last factor to consider before jumping into pricing is the strategic landscape.

Recall that your interviewer already confirmed that the AVs drive safer than humans and that the technology is approved by regulators, so those two important factors don't pose risks. The most important thing to note about the space Uber operates in is that it's highly competitive:

"Most rideshare users care about convenience and price; there's not much brand loyalty to speak of. Users often compare Uber with competitors like Lyft when they're looking for a ride. This means that Uber's margin is squeezed; it must keep ride prices low to avoid losing customers, yet it must keep rates high enough to acquire drivers especially during peak hours.

Another thing to consider is that San Francisco has public transit options, especially in its most populous areas. These options are usually lower cost at the expense of longer travel times. Users could also just walk or drive themselves.

Overall, it's a tough environment. Uber faces significant competition with thin margins. AV technology is not widespread though, so it's a potential differentiator."

#### Brainstorm Pricing Options

Next, brainstorm pricing options. Uber already has a pricing structure in place, so you'd want to start there. Then, adjust the pricing model to accommodate the AV fleet, including any strategic factors you previously identified:

"Uber has a marketplace model that prices rides dynamically, based on current supply and demand. I see no reason not to use this pricing model as a baseline, and adjust it to the AV product. For example, at peak hours, the AVs will create some increase in supply, but the increase will be more notable during off-hours where they can provide a significant, predictable baseline; for example, for users trying to get a ride at 5:00 a.m.

On the strategic side, we're assuming that Uber is trying to grow market share. To do that, it needs to get users excited enough about this technology, or, the AVs need to be better priced and more convenient than the competition. While Uber could explore putting a premium on the price as a signal of quality, it seems the best way to encourage usage is to offer these rides at a lower price than the competition. Uber can afford to do this because AVs have lower per-mile costs. Lower prices might encourage users who are hesitant about AVs to give them a chance.

One final consideration is that, from an Uber-wide perspective, AVs will compete with existing services. Uber won't want to lose drivers, so AVs can't be priced so low that users will be hesitant to take standard rides. There will have to be a balance between these factors."

#### Make Pricing Recommendation

Given the above, you're ready to give a more specific answer to the question at hand:

"Overall, I would propose that Uber use a market-based pricing model with a slight discount on AV rides to place prices below the competition. Uber's margins are likely thin, so I'll estimate that Uber can tolerate a price reduction of about 20%. Ideally, I'd want to better understand exactly what Uber's tolerable loss-to-profit-margin is with the goal of outpacing competition in the long term. Without further information, I'd recommend aiming for rides to cost about 20% less than UberX."

#### Evaluate and Consider Long-term

As you wrap up, evaluate your answer. Consider strategic pitfalls that might challenge your pricing model. To dive a little deeper, you might consider how this strategy plays out long term or how you'd account for risks you identified but didn't cover in detail:

- **Longer-term vision**: You could talk about how the initial AV rollout helps Uber get to a fully autonomous fleet and plan pricing around that goal.
- **Price evolution**: You could propose that Uber offer a promotion (at first) to get riders interested, then raise prices once riders are used to the service.
- **Competitive response**: You could consider how competitors might react to this and what you could advise to watch out for with this strategy. For example, competitors might temporarily raise driver pay to drive discontent with Uber, causing operational and public relations issues.

### Pricing Strategy Framework Summary

1. **Define the landscape** - Understand value proposition, launch context, company goals, competitive factors
2. **Identify pricing strategies** - Consider value-based, cost-plus, dynamic pricing approaches
3. **Adapt existing models** - Leverage current pricing structure if available
4. **Consider strategic goals** - Align pricing with company mission and market position
5. **Make specific recommendation** - Provide concrete pricing with clear rationale
6. **Evaluate long-term implications** - Discuss evolution, risks, and competitive responses

## How to Answer Growth Strategy Questions

Growth strategy questions assess your ability to find the right levers to pull to maximize growth. Example questions include:

- "How would you increase the number YouTube users?"
- "How would you 10X Google Cloud IoT usage?"
- "How would you increase Gmail ads revenue by 20%?"

There are many paths to growth. Depending on the question you might decide to focus on attracting new users, driving engagement with existing users, or even reducing churn. Your choice will be highly context-dependent. The key may lie in untapped user behavior, alterations to the product or the business model, or a strategic partnership.

Growth questions can be answered using the standard strategy framework with a slightly different lens. You'll spend more time making sense of where the product/company is now and diving deeper into key factors like user behavior to figure out how to drive growth.

### Step 1: Define the Landscape

Begin by clarifying the problem and gathering enough context to allow you to model the goal as a simple equation.

For example, say you were asked to reduce churn by 10%. Churn rate = (lost customers / Total customers at the beginning of the period) x 100.

From this equation, you know that you need to either decrease the number of lost customers or keep the number of lost customers steady while increasing total customers - or both. Check-in with your interviewer and confirm that your model reflects the situation at hand. If there is any ambiguity in the question, ask your interviewer.

Ask any questions that will help you understand the product, company, and landscape considerations impacting the status quo and how they might play into growth goals. Be sure you understand:

- The key value drivers of the product or business
- Any existing strategies; understand why they were chosen, what metrics are being tracked, and how those metrics have changed over time
- Any specific strengths and weaknesses in the product or business

### Step 2: Identify Options for Growth

Next, you'll define an overall strategy that makes sense for increasing growth given your goal and the context you outlined. From there, you'll brainstorm options, choose one, justify, and evaluate your answer.

Here are some common growth strategies to be aware of:

- **Market Penetration**: Growth opportunities abound in existing markets. To penetrate deeper into a current market, companies typically work to increase market share by attracting new users or altering their pricing strategy. This can also involve increasing marketing efforts, enhancing product features, or considering mergers and acquisitions within the same market to consolidate and expand their presence.

- **Market Expansion**: Instead of focusing on the existing market, companies will often work to expand their reach by entering new markets with their existing products. This could involve geographic expansion, targeting new customer segments, or finding new uses for an existing product.

- **Product Development**: Instead of looking for new users for an existing product, companies can expand their product offerings to continue selling in the same market.

- **Diversification**: With a diversification strategy, a company might try to enter a new market with a new product. Diversification is generally considered the riskiest growth strategy.

As you work on your overall strategy, consider where the company is in the marketplace, what its overall business strategy is, and what the company's mission and culture are. A small startup might get away with a bolder move than a large entrenched player, for example. You don't want to give an answer that's out of touch with the ethos of the company.

As you identify opportunities, don't be afraid to dig deep into user behavior. Generally, growing a company means reaching more users or getting "better" usage. Consider the user subsets who aren't using your product - are there large groups that have characteristics or even pain points in common? The larger the subset, the easier it will be to achieve significant growth if you reach them, though you should always be cautious when making assumptions about large groups. Ask your interviewer more clarifying questions if there are specific insights you're looking for.

Finally, prioritize the next steps of your plan to increase growth and summarize and evaluate your answer. To prioritize, be sure to refer back to the product and company strengths you identified and your understanding of the market. Consider:

- Likelihood of success
- Expected impact
- Any short (and especially) long-term strategic benefits

Once you've made your choice, recap your process and evaluate your answer. You might:
- Transition into product thinking to come up with a feature or a new product that fills a gap identified
- Briefly explore an alternate idea that you didn't go in-depth on, say, a strategic partnership or acquisition that might offer synergies
- Offer risk mitigation strategies for any risks that came up
- Discuss the details of executing your plan, including any metrics you'd track, and counter metrics you'd want to keep an eye on

### Growth Example: YouTube Watch Time

Let's work through an example: "How would you increase YouTube's average watch time by 2x in the next 3 years?"

#### Clarify the Problem

First, clarify any ambiguity in the question:

"Do we mean the watch time for all YouTube products or for the core YouTube product?"

Let's assume your interviewer confirms that you're increasing watch time for the core product only. Now, create a high-level equation to capture your goal:

"I think of average watch time as number of users x (average watch time / user). To drive average watch time up, we'd need to increase either the number of users, or the average watch time per user (while holding the other constant, at least). The best case, of course, is that we raise both. Does that capture the situation?"

#### Understand Current Context

Assume your interviewer gives the go-ahead. The goal is relatively straightforward, but you should still aim to arrive at a better understanding of YouTube's strategy, its place in the competitive landscape, and its current approach:

"YouTube represents the largest video platform in the marketplace. It's dominant in many (but not all) of the markets they're in. It has billions of users and the watch time is likely in the hundreds of billions of hours per year. YouTube does really well with educational content, longer video logs (vlogs), and is basically the default for embedding video on the web."

"YouTube does have some notable competitors across different types of video content, from TikTok (at the short end) to Netflix (at the premium end). YouTube has tried to compete with both to some extent, with Shorts and Originals, as short-form video is a notably fast-growing space."

#### Generate Growth Opportunities

Next, it's time to generate opportunities for growth. Given the context defined and your model, what opportunities are available? Recalling your high-level equation where you identified that to grow YouTube, you'd need to increase the number of users or watch time (or both):

"To acquire new users, we'd need to grant access to users who currently can't use YouTube or acquire users who don't use YouTube by choice. Given the scale of YouTube, the second group is probably small and fragmented. To increase watch time, we could consider why people watch YouTube and what keeps them from watching more. I'd guess that a few of the key reasons are:

- Limited time to spend watching video
- Data limitations
- Preference for other kinds of content (e.g. short-form video)

For the purposes of this discussion, I'll proceed with the goal of increasing watch time rather than acquiring new users."

#### Dig Into User Behavior

You may find more specific and actionable angles to the problem if you decide to dig deeper into specific use cases. Niches won't get you to 2x growth, but there may be important use cases worth considering. Some options to explore might include influencer content or potential upside in educational content:

"Influencer content is a huge use case, and one problem affecting YouTube is that many influencers favor other platforms, reducing the time viewers spend on YouTube. Likewise, educational content is already a big vertical, but many people don't consider YouTube their first choice for learning, so there's likely still more upside for growth."

#### Prioritize Growth Options

There are many options to consider. Use your judgment, but remember, getting more specific about user behaviors, types of content, and how the market interferes with watch time could all yield valuable insights. Given the challenges above, assume you've narrowed your brainstorm down to the following ideas to expand watch time:

"My top ideas are:

1. Expand in international markets
2. Claim a larger share of short videos
3. Get back into premium video
4. Expand in a new or underserved use case, like education or influencer content"

#### Make Strategic Recommendation

With the shortlist above, it's time to prioritize a strategy, building on YouTube's strengths and your understanding of the market. Remember to consider factors like the likelihood of success, expected impact, and any longer-term strategic benefits:

"In this case, I believe expanding our footprint in short-form video could be a good strategy. Though we haven't had great success yet and there's tough competition for viewers and creators, it's an important and large space. We have significant strengths as a brand and platform, especially because many TikTok creators do also maintain a YouTube presence. Succeeding here also helps us expand in verticals like education, so this helps us continue to grow."

#### Address Previous Failures

In this example, you noted that YouTube had failed to seriously compete in short-form video in the past. If you want to recommend that strategy going forward, you'd want to call out why YouTube hasn't found success and account for that in your strategy:

"Notably, we've tried, but we haven't succeeded yet in this space. To move forward, we'd need a more concrete plan to show that success is feasible. Leaning into the strengths of YouTube, it doesn't make sense to just copy competitors like TikTok or Reels. We should use our position to our advantage, that is, our existing content, brand, relationships with creators, connection to Google, and more."

From here, you could go a number of ways:
- You could dive into a bit of product thinking here to come up with a valuable product
- You could think about partnerships or programs to drive more creators to YouTube
- You could think about acquisition targets to give YouTube a boost in audience or product functionality

Let's assume for the sake of the example that you suggest building an app for Shorts — leveraging YouTube's strengths in a form factor commonly used with short video.

#### Evaluate Risks and Tradeoffs

As you close your answer, you'd consider risks, challenges, and tradeoffs:

"The largest risk, as we acknowledged before, is that YouTube faces strong competition here and we haven't yet succeeded in the space. This comes with a risk of wasting resources and attention but continuing not to make gains. I suggested building an app for Shorts. One important tradeoff here is that while an app may make it easier to acquire some users, it will be more difficult to bring them into the larger YouTube ecosystem. This might not be important though; it's a factor worth digging into more deeply given more time."

### 3. Execution Questions

Execution questions assess a candidate's experience in problem-solving, team management, and data-driven decision-making. The format of these questions varies, but the most common types are root cause analysis and decision-making questions.

#### How to Answer Root Cause Analysis Questions

The most common type of execution question is root cause analysis.

Root cause analysis (RCA) questions present a scenario. Something unexpected has happened with a product, and as a PM, it's your responsibility to figure out what's going on. For example, an interviewer might ask:

"Imagine you are a PM at Lyft and there's been a 20% increase in ride cancellations. What would you do about this?"

These interviews are unlike most others in the PM loop in that they are conducted via a "role-play" interviewing style. Your interviewer expects you to ask questions about the context of the problem, the product, and any relevant metrics. Using the information you gather, you'll iterate through increasingly precise hypotheses until you identify a root cause. Often, your interviewer will play the role of an uninformed data analyst, requiring you to ask concrete questions about reasonably available data.

For example, one of your first clarifying questions might be "Is there anything unusual going on with drivers?" In other PM interviews your interviewer would answer directly, but in execution interviews, they'll likely respond with something like "As a data analyst, I can help you if you clarify what you want to know in terms of data we might have about drivers?"

The interviewer will push you to be more specific and concrete about your requests for data throughout the interview.

**What Interviewers Are Looking For**

Your ultimate goal in working through RCA questions is to identify the root cause of the problem, but your interviewer will care most about your approach.

RCA questions are different from product design, strategy, and analytical questions in that they do have a correct answer, but a logical and thoughtful approach to problem-solving can land you a "strong hire" recommendation even if you don't arrive at the exact right solution. Be sure to demonstrate your ability to make sense of a situation given limited data, generate and continually refine reasonable hypotheses as you learn more information, gather information iteratively through targeted questions, and ultimately identify a root cause that explains the observed problem.

**A Framework for Answering RCA Questions**

RCA questions at most companies are designed to be solved in 25 minutes so a framework to keep you on track is critical. Follow this 6-step process:

1. **Clarify and gather context**
2. **Form high-level hypotheses**
3. **Gather data**
4. **Refine hypotheses and repeat**
5. **Identify the root cause**
6. **Evaluate**

Let's continue the Lyft RCA question as an example. Assume you've been asked:

"Imagine you are a PM at Lyft and there's been a 20% increase in ride cancellations. What would you do about this?"

**Step 1: Clarify and Gather Context**

First, ask clarifying questions about anything that will help you make sense of the issue, scope the problem, and align with your interviewer.

Don't hesitate to ask broad questions like "How does this affect our core business?" but be aware that your interviewer may not give you direct answers. Instead, they're likely to prompt you to ask for specific data that you'd reasonably have access to as PM.

A helpful tip for getting into the right mindset is to envision what it'd really be like to be in the situation you've been given. What would your priorities be as PM? What kind of data would you need to begin to diagnose the issue?

**Example:** For our example question "Imagine you are a PM at Lyft and there's been a 20% increase in ride cancellations. What would you do about this?" you'd want to clarify what "ride cancellations" means since this could be interpreted in multiple ways. You'd also want to know what the baseline is for comparison when considering a "20% increase." You should ask what counts as a ride cancellation, whether you're seeing cancellations both before matching with a driver and after, whether you're only seeing riders canceling or if this number includes drivers too, what this 20% increase is compared to (such as week over week), and whether cancellations have been steadily increasing or if you're seeing a sudden spike.

Note that this question is very specific. Completed rides are central to Lyft's business, so it's obvious that a 20% increase in ride cancellations is bad. You may get a more ambiguous question, like "10% of Netflix users are inactive. What would you do?" In this case, ask clarifying questions about how this affects business. You may find that what's been framed as a problem may not be the core issue.

**Step 2: Form High-Level Hypotheses**

Once you've gathered some context, you can start forming high-level hypotheses about what may have happened. Keep in mind that you have limited time to narrow your scope, so a good strategy is to first eliminate broad areas from consideration.

At this stage, you're simply breaking up the universe of possible root causes into meaningful chunks that you can dive into later and eventually prioritize or discard. Common sources of problems include unintended technical issues or product bugs, product changes that were possibly intended but had unintended consequences, operational changes within the company, and external events beyond the company's direct control.

Remember that communicating your process is critical, so share your full list of hypotheses with your interviewer before you begin prioritizing in the next step.

**Example:** For our example question regarding Lyft cancellations, your broad hypotheses might include a product bug or technical issue such as rides being automatically canceled or an issue with the app not showing users that a driver is on the way. It could also be a product change in the Lyft app such as making the "cancel" button more prominent. Another possibility is a change to rider/driver operations, which is a key component of the service—for example, a change in driver pay that leads drivers to cancel less profitable rides. Finally, it could be an external factor like a Taylor Swift concert that has created massive traffic, causing users to cancel when they see long wait times.

**Step 3: Gather Data**

At this point, you've got a solid set of high-level hypotheses. The next step is to determine which of these is worth expanding on. You'll do that by gathering more data.

One helpful strategy for identifying what's driving the problem is to isolate key variables. For the sake of an execution interview, a key variable is a variable that correlates highly with the issue at hand.

For example, say you're diagnosing a problem with a smartphone app and the problem is evenly distributed between users across age groups and geographic locations. If, when you look at the distribution of errors experienced by device, you see that 90% of users experiencing the issue use a Google Pixel, you might consider device to be a key variable.

You'd then gather more data to figure out what Google Pixel usage correlates with the issue. It could be a certain version of the app installed on Pixels, something about the device itself, or even a factor that users who buy Pixels have in common. To isolate key variables, ask yourself which variables could reasonably be correlated with the variation you're seeing and how you might test whether these variables are having an impact without confounding variables affecting the outcome.

When you're ready, ask your interviewer whatever questions feel meaningful to help you gather the right data. Be sure to explain why you're asking each question and how the answer changes your understanding of the problem.

**Example:** Recall that you brainstormed the following list of high-level hypotheses that might explain the increase in cancellations:

- A product bug or technical issue such as rides being canceled or an issue with the app not showing users that a driver is on the way.
- A product change in the Lyft app such as making the "cancel" button more prominent.
- A change to our rider/driver operations such as a change in driver pay that leads drivers to cancel less profitable rides.
- An external factor like a Taylor Swift concert has created massive traffic causing users to cancel when they see long wait times.

Continuing the example:

"If a product or technical issue caused this, we should be able to attribute it to a particular launch or update. Were there any releases that happened around the time of the spike? Was there a particular version of the app where this started? If so, app version would be a variable we've isolated as affecting this metric, which gives us a clear direction to explore.

If a change in our operations is causing the cancellations, it's likely that other metrics have been affected. Have we seen a change in the number of active drivers? Have we seen a change in the number of ride requests?"

Assume the interviewer tells you:
- There's no clear release or app version that caused the issue.
- We have seen a drop in the number of drivers who complete a ride, but no drop in ride requests.

**Step 4: Refine Hypotheses and Repeat**

The goal here is to gather evidence to either support or deprioritize each hypothesis as you drive toward the root cause of the problem.

With more data, refine your hypotheses, generate new questions to ask, and refine further. You may find yourself repeating this step a few times. This is normal. Every additional piece of data helps to make your hypotheses more specific.

Be sure to communicate every step of your thought process to your interviewer and check in frequently. Doing so can preempt tough follow-up questions after you give your final answer.

**Example:** Continuing our Lyft example, recall that your interviewer confirmed that:

- There has been no clear release or app version that caused the increase in ride cancellations.
- There has been a drop in number of drivers who complete a ride, but no drop in ride requests.

Refine your hypothesis as follows:

"Based on these insights, I'd like to deprioritize my hypotheses that the increase in cancellations is due to either a technical issue or a product change, as there's no evidence that a release or app version is causing the increase in cancellations, and we haven't seen a decrease in ride requests.

There is more evidence that the issue is related to our operations or an external event. Specifically, it seems like something that's particularly affecting drivers. Perhaps riders are seeing longer wait times (because there are fewer drivers) so they're canceling."

Let's assume that your interviewer confirms that your analysis is correct, and that drivers are being affected.

**Step 5: Identify the Root Cause**

Once you have enough data, explain what you think the root cause of the issue is. If you've communicated your thought process throughout, you'll have made a logical case for your choice, so you'll only need to give a quick summary here before moving on to evaluation.

**Example:** Continuing our Lyft example, recall that you have confirmation from your interviewer that the problem is:

- Likely related to Lyft's operations, an external event, or both
- Affecting drivers specifically

Given this insight, it would be helpful to consider what factors would affect drivers' willingness and ability to drive. Here are a few specific hypotheses that fit the information you have:

- An external event is causing traffic difficulties
- Drivers are unhappy with Lyft and leaving
- Drivers are being paid or treated better on another platform and so are being pulled away

Assume you've found no evidence that an external event is causing traffic difficulties over the time period in question, and there is no strong evidence to support drivers are unhappier with Lyft than they were prior to the increase in cancellations. You'd be left with the hypothesis that drivers are being paid or treated better elsewhere, and are leaving Lyft for another platform.

**Step 6: Evaluate**

If you followed the framework and communicated throughout, your answer will be backed up by data. Quickly recap your major findings, and then spend a few minutes discussing what to do about the root cause you've identified. Consider:

- Whether the root cause should be fixed. Sometimes, a change in a metric is caused by a product change that the company is otherwise happy with. The next steps may just be to keep an eye on things and to act only when it's clear user experience is being degraded.
- If a fix is needed, consider what mitigation makes sense. Many candidates reach for a product change immediately, but that's not always the best option. Use your judgment as a PM.

**Example:** Wrapping up our Lyft example, let's say that your interviewer confirms that your hypothesis is correct and that Uber recently increased driver pay substantially, drawing drivers away from Lyft. Close with:

"In the short term, Lyft is losing out — but given margins, I can't imagine Uber would be able to sustain the economics of such an increase for the long term. We could choose to do nothing for now and wait for Uber to eventually reduce driver pay.

If we did want to respond, I would consider small changes to the app such as making the 'cancel' button slightly less prominent. We might also consider more drastic measures such as charging a fee for cancellation, but this could drastically harm the user experience.

Another option could be to raise driver pay to match Uber's, but we would need to understand the business implications in much more depth before choosing to go that route."

**"Okay" vs. "Good" vs. "Great" Answers**

- **In an okay answer**, the candidate asks questions that are relevant and offers a light interpretation of the situation but doesn't explain their overall thinking on the problem. It feels like they have an intuitive sense of what could be going on, but it's not clear if their approach is comprehensive or deeply thought out. Alternately, they may quickly jump to plausible but specific explanations and focus on proving or disproving them, slowing down their ability to make sense of the situation.

- **A good answer** is one where the candidate shares what possibilities they're considering and it is clear why they're asking the questions they do. The candidate interprets responses and explains how they change their understanding. The candidate confidently navigates the possibility space and it feels like they make steady progress toward an answer.

- **A great answer** does the above but also displays deep insight and ability to contextualize the problem and uses that to guide their approach. For instance, the candidate might draw on product insights, explaining why and when users or drivers cancel, then apply that to quickly narrow in on the most important metrics to check. While regular answers to these questions usually feel like an exploration, great answers often feel like they quickly and intelligently cut through the possibilities and lock on to the heart of the problem.

**Common RCA Pitfalls**

- **Immediately guessing at the root cause**: If you are trying to prove or disprove a narrow hypothesis, it will take a long time to find the answer (or the interviewer will give up and guide you toward the answer to keep moving.)
- **Not explaining what you're considering or why you're asking particular questions**: If you don't explain your approach, you're more likely to get lost. To the interviewer, it may feel like there's no rhyme or reason to your process. It also makes it harder for the interviewer to guide or help you.

#### How to Answer Decision-Making Questions

Decision-making questions present a scenario where you're asked to make a product decision. Often, your choices are similar and there's no obvious winner. For example, you may be asked:

"You're a PM on Facebook Watch. Your team is working on a redesign. This redesign improved the watch time, but it also caused a drop in likes and comments. Should you ship this redesign?"

The key to delivering a solid answer is to spend time clarifying product and company goals and defining decision criteria upfront.

**What Interviewers Are Looking For**

Interviewers are looking the same skill set as in RCA questions, but there is added emphasis on:

- Product thinking
- Strategic thinking and business acumen
- Ability to evaluate options

Note that decision-making questions are an excellent opportunity for you to showcase your domain expertise, so don't shy away from referencing personal experience.

**A Framework for Answering Decision-Making Questions**

Decision-making questions are designed to take roughly 25 minutes. Follow this 4-step process to arrive at a decision efficiently and confidently:

1. **Clarify and gather information**
2. **Set decision criteria**
3. **Evaluate options**
4. **Decide and recap**

Let's continue using the above question as an example. Assume you've been asked:

"You're a PM on Facebook Watch. Your team is working on a redesign. This redesign improved watch time, but it also caused a drop in likes and comments. Should you ship this?"

**Step 1: Clarify and Gather Information**

Decision-making questions require you to make a big decision without much context, so always begin by asking clarifying questions. In the next step, you'll begin to explain your criteria for evaluating your options, so your goal here should be to gather enough information to understand how your decision will ultimately affect business and define your priorities as a PM.

Clarify any unclear terms including company names, important nouns, and adjectives. If a metric was referenced, be sure to gather more information about that metric. What is the baseline value you're comparing against? Is the change positive or negative (or is this unclear?)

Don't hesitate to ask questions about how the scenario you've been given affects the business, but be aware that your interviewer might not offer that information. In that case, it's fair to make assumptions based on what you know of the product or company and its goals, but be sure to communicate any assumptions to your interviewer.

**Example:** For our example question "You're a PM on Facebook Watch. Your team is working on a redesign. This redesign improved watch time, but it also caused a drop in likes and comments. Should you ship this?" There is a lot of missing information. You'd want to ask specifically about product and company goals, clarify the vague metrics referenced, and try to gather details about the redesign. For example:

**Product and company goals**
- "How does Facebook Watch fit into Meta's mission and strategic goals?"

**Metrics**
- "How much did watch time increase, and how much did likes and comments decrease?"
- "Should I assume total watch time increased, or is this watch time per session?"
- "Are these likes and comment metrics specific to video, or are we seeing this effect across other types of content?"

**Redesign**
- "Why did we decide to redesign Facebook Watch?"
- "What was changed?"

Let's assume your interviewer told you that total watch time increased with the redesign, and that likes and comments are down for video only. Otherwise, they told you not to focus on the specifics of the redesign, and that you should assume whatever makes sense to you.

**Step 2: Set Decision Criteria**

Next, set decision criteria based on the information you gleaned in the last step.

Setting decision criteria is similar to goal setting in other interviews. Aim to sum up the most important factor(s) to consider based on the context defined above. Clear decision criteria will help you stay focused and objective while building support for your decision later, so we recommend spending significant time on this step.

Your decision criteria will hinge on what's most important to your product and to the company. Use your judgment to figure out what's most relevant to your question. Common areas to consider include:

- Strategic product or company goals
- The current market including key competitors, trends, pending regulation, etc.
- Clear user needs or pain points
- The company's mission

Explain your thought process to your interviewer and repeat your key takeaways before moving on. If you have access to a whiteboard, record your decision criteria so you can refer back later.

**Example:** Continuing our example question "You're a PM on Facebook Watch. Your team is working on a redesign. This redesign improved watch time, but it also caused a drop in likes and comments. Should you ship this?" There are many contexts you might explore. For instance:

"Meta's mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together, and video is a rich medium for communicating.

Video allows for better monetization through ads, both as a platform for display and as a way to keep users engaged.

Strategically, Meta has invested in video content across several platforms and is in close competition with other platforms that are video-forward, like TikTok and YouTube.

In particular, short-form video is a fast-growing and important sector in video content. Meta released Instagram Reels to compete in the space, and Reels also surface on Facebook.

Given all this, it's critical that Facebook is seen as a go-to destination for video, both for sharing and watching. As the market for video changes, Facebook has an opportunity to become a leader in the space.

This will be the basis of my decision criteria moving forward. I will evaluate my options based on how well either shipping or not shipping the redesign supports the goal of making Facebook a go-to destination for video, particularly short-form video."

**Step 3: Generate and Weigh Options**

Now it's time to come up with options. If you haven't already been given options to choose from, brainstorm a few solutions. Variation is good; coming up with three entirely different solutions is better than coming up with five variations on the same idea.

**Tip:** Keep your mind open, and try not to evaluate options against your criteria just yet. If you do, you're prone to making a decision right away and sandbagging the other option(s).

Briefly discuss:
- The potential effects of each option, both positive and negative
- Any important dependencies that might affect the overall outcome
- The tradeoffs associated with each

Be sure to make the pros and cons of each option very explicit. This will ensure that your decision rests on logic rather than gut instinct. Only after you've fully fleshed out options, dependencies, and trade-offs should you begin to weigh your options against your decision criteria.

**Example:** For our Facebook Watch example question, your options are already clear. You've been asked whether you should or should not ship the redesign — no brainstorming is required. Instead, weigh your options:

"Shipping the redesign improves watch time. This means users are watching more and/or longer videos, learning from them, or otherwise enjoying them. Increased watch time also increases ad revenue. Creators will be happy that they'll get more views and revenue. However, a reduction in likes and comments might reduce the sense of community around video — a key component of Meta's company mission. For short-form content, keeping users engaged with the videos and building a behavioral loop around watching is particularly important.

On the other hand, not shipping leads to more comments and likes. Comments and likes are how users communicate about video content; their voice. Viewers and creators might form stronger bonds because of that two-way communication. However, many creators won't care about comments more than views and watch time."

**Step 4: Decide and Recap**

Finally, decide which option offers the most benefits and fewest risks based on your decision criteria. If you followed the previous steps, your decision should be fairly to easy to justify.

Quickly recap the logic behind your decision criteria and your choice given your options. Tradeoffs will have been covered in the previous step, so your evaluation of your answer will focus on what to do next. Consider mitigation strategies or compromises you might make, and offer ideas for solving potential issues that might come up.

**Example:** As we close our example answer, recall that you've come to the following conclusions:

- It's critical that Facebook is seen as a go-to destination for video, both for sharing and watching
- Shipping the redesign improves total watch time
- Not shipping leads to more comments and likes

Close with something like:

"Evaluating against my decision criteria, which is that it's critical that Facebook is a go-to destination for video, I'll choose to ship. While comments and likes are valuable, watching video is the core behavior that viewers come to do and it supports creators more directly. A decrease in likes and comments might degrade the sense of community initially, but many creators won't care about likes and comments more than watch time because watch time affects their revenue. If we're not at risk of losing creators with the redesign, I'm confident we'll continue to draw viewers, particularly in short-form content.

Given more time, I would like to investigate why the redesign is reducing likes and comments, as both are important for cultivating the sense of community Meta strives for. There may be an easy fix for bringing likes and comments back up without scrapping the redesign. For example, if the redesign made the video player bigger and likes and comments got cut off on the page, I'd consider proposing a new feature where likes and comments shift to the top of the screen."

**"Okay" vs. "Good" vs. "Great" Decision-Making Answers**

- **An okay answer** explains the trade-offs between options. The candidate does a reasonable job evaluating these trade-offs and makes a coherent argument for their choice, drawing on product or strategic insights.

- **A good answer** places the situation within a larger product context. This context informs the criteria used to evaluate the situation. The candidate paints a picture of how the trade-offs affect the product as a whole and their decision is well-supported.

- **A great answer** demonstrates a deep understanding of the product or strategy, allowing the candidate to identify the key factors at play. The trade-offs and their impact on the product are deeply thought through and go beyond obvious, immediate effects. Additionally, the candidate might even suggest how to execute their decision, say by finding a middle-ground approach that optimizes the benefits or by devising a release strategy that minimizes risk.

**Common Decision-Making Pitfalls**

- **Deciding too early**: Don't make a snap decision when you hear the options. Keep your mind open throughout, and you may be surprised to find another option that makes more sense. Choosing too early often leads to downplaying your evaluation of the other options to try to "convince" your interviewer. They'll wonder why you missed potential benefits.

- **Not setting decision criteria early**: These questions are about trade-offs, so you have to be able to evaluate what trade-offs make sense. If you don't have decision criteria, you'll end up making a decision after the fact, leaving you with a weaker argument.

### 4. Analytical Questions

Analytical questions focus on your ability to collect and analyze relevant data and make decisions accordingly. Developing a logical process for choosing metrics and designing experiments is key, as is the ability to justify your decision-making throughout.

The major subcategories of analytical questions deal with metrics and experimentation, especially A/B testing. There is often overlap with estimation and execution questions which also assess your ability to break down problems and take action in ambiguous situations.

To answer these:
- Aim to establish your ability to use data and metrics to inform product decisions and drive development
- Explain what different metrics can tell you about product performance, and where they fall short
- Explain what experiments you'd run to gain insight into open questions, and how the results would validate your assumptions
- Discuss how you identify and track key performance indicators (KPIs) to guide product development

**Examples of analytical questions:**
- "You're the PM of YouTube's Analytics. What would you pick as the three key metrics, and why?"
- "How would you determine success for Instagram Reels?"
- "Devise an A/B test to improve user frustration with Google Maps"

## How to Answer A/B Testing Questions

A/B tests are one of the core tools a product manager can employ for understanding user behavior. In fact, at many large tech companies, product managers are heavily involved with experimentation as a means to validate their product decisions.

This is why A/B testing-related questions are often asked in a product management interview. For example:

- "What experiments would you run on Google's homepage to increase search queries?"
- "What are the top 3 types of A/B Experiments you would run on Facebook ads to increase revenue?"

An excellent experimentation interview answer will cover these five critical basics:

### 1. Hypothesis

First, for any A/B experiment you propose, tell your interviewer what your hypothesis is. What are you actually even testing here? For example, perhaps you believe that by increasing the size of a button, it will increase the clickthrough rate (CTR).

### 2. Methodology

Now that we have a hypothesis, what exactly are we going to engineer differently to test this hypothesis? For instance, let's run two cohorts of users. In the first cohort, the users will be our control, and will see exactly the same experience as present. In the second cohort, the users will see a button that is increased in area by 50%.

It's important to be precise here. The interviewer needs to understand what exactly is being proposed, and what the experimental setup will look like. A big component of precision in methodology is defining who exactly the experiment is being run on. Are we targeting all users on the platform? Or should we pick a proper segment of users for whom we feel this test will be particularly well suited.

Don't forget to add a control to your experiments — without a control, it's impossible to actually gain useful insights from the data.

### 3. Metrics

Great, now we have an experimental setup. Next, you need to tell your interviewer what metrics you'll be actually concerned with. What metrics will actually convey useful insights to your product and engineering teams?

In the button example, you'll obviously want to be tracking CTR, but there are a few other metrics that might be relevant and are worth listing:

- Impression count
- CTR on other buttons on the page
- Button hover time
- Time spent on page
- Bounce rate on the button's clickthrough link (assuming the button leads to a new webpage)

To answer these questions, you'll need to understand the goals of the experiment and anticipate potential pitfalls from launching the proposed redesign.

### 4. Impact

At the end of a day, running an experiment just tells us information. Tell your interviewer how this information will actually be useful. What metrics will you use to make an informed decision about whether or not to launch the proposed feature?

Perhaps you want to ensure that CTR increases with the redesign. Or perhaps the increased clicks on the button shouldn't decrease the overall clicks of buttons on the page.

Ultimately, the answer to this question depends on the specific feature and the goal of the redesign. Here is a great opportunity to relate your answer to the overall vision and goals of the company.

### 5. Tradeoffs

Lastly, every proposed redesign or feature has some sort of tradeoff. What are some potential pitfalls to launching your proposed feature that might not be evident via a purely data-based analysis?

For example, perhaps, by making the button larger, you'll increase the CTR on that button in question at the expense of other elements on the page. Some other great examples of points to make in typical A/B interview questions are qualities like "meaningful interactions" and user delight. These are not easily captured via metrics, and therefore are often missed in an overly quantitative mindset.

## How to Answer Metrics Questions

Expect to face metrics questions that assess your ability to set feature/product/company goals, brainstorm and select relevant metrics, and apply product and strategic reasoning. Common questions include:

- "Define a north star metric for Airbnb"
- "What metrics would you measure as a PM launching a new feature on WhatsApp?"
- "How do you define success metrics?"

Common follow-up questions include:
- "What additional metrics besides your north star would be helpful to track?"
- "Are there any blind spots or challenges associated with your chosen metrics?"
- "What strategies can you think of for driving your metrics?"

### The GAME Framework for Metrics Questions

We recommend the GAME framework as an effective method for moving through metrics questions:

**Step 1: Clarify**
**Step 2: Goals**
**Step 3: Actions**
**Step 4: Metrics**
**Step 5: Evaluate**

Let's work through an example: "How would you measure the success of Instagram's Discover feed?"

#### Step 1: Clarify

Clarify any ambiguity in the question and state your assumptions first. This way, you'll ensure you're on track as you begin to build out your answer.

**Example clarifying questions:**
- "Should I be considering Meta's goals as the parent company of Instagram?"
- "Should I include the search bar in the Discover feed in this analysis?"

Let's assume the interviewer says that you should consider Meta's goals and that the search bar is out-of-scope for now.

#### Step 2: Goals

Next, begin defining the main goals for the company, product, or feature. You'll refer back to this goals analysis throughout your answer. Consider:

- What is the product vision?
- What is this product's point of view?
- How does this support the company mission?

**Example:**
"I am assuming that Meta's mission is to give people the power to build community. The Discover feed is an interest-based feed that shows users content they wouldn't find otherwise, which supports Meta's mission by exposing users to new parts of the world.

For now, I'll claim that the goal of the Discover feed is 'Help users develop and expand their interests.'"

#### Step 3: Actions

Once you've settled on a clear goal, it's time to build a list of actions you want to see users take in support of that goal. A common technique for building this list is to run through a user journey map.

**Example user journey for the Discover feed:**
1. User opens Instagram and is shown the Home feed
2. User clicks on the Discover tab and sees the grid of posts and Reels
3. User scrolls through the content
4. User clicks on a post or Reel, which expands it
5. User may like, comment, visit the poster's profile, etc.
6. User may return to the feed or exit the app

**Key actions that indicate users are developing and expanding their interests:**
- Open the Discover feed regularly
- Open the posts we show them
- Like, comment on, or share content we show them there
- Follow creators they find there
- Scroll for more content
- Search for related topics

#### Step 4: Metrics

Once you've identified key actions users should take, it's time to build out a list of relevant metrics to track these key actions. Consider these types of metrics:

**Product metrics:** Daily Active Users (DAU), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Time Spent
**Objectives and key results (OKRs):** Acquired users in specific markets, DAU growth for a product, Churn reduction
**Business metrics:** Revenue, Net profit margin, Customer lifetime value
**Quality metrics:** Bug backlog size, Mean time to resolution (MTTR), Page load time
**Leading indicators:** User signups, Button clicks
**Counter (guardrail) metrics:** Churn rate, Customer satisfaction scores

**Example metrics brainstorm:**
"In order for users to develop and expand their interests through the Discover feed, they need to open the feed regularly and interact with the content in some way. I believe opening posts users have been shown on the Discover feed is critical.

There are multiple ways to measure how users are opening posts from the Discover feed:
- Total number of posts opened by user
- Time spent looking at content by user per session
- Scroll depth per session per user
- Percentage of Discover sessions with a post click

Each option tells me something slightly different. Returning to my stated goal - if I want to know that users are developing their interests, I would choose time spent by user per session as my metric, as it also captures depth of interest."

#### Step 5: Evaluate

All metrics are strong in some areas and weak in others. Describe the tradeoffs of different metrics you considered. Ask yourself "Where does my metric fall short?"

**Example evaluation:**
"I chose time spent as my key metric, but I can see a case where users spend a lot of time on the Discover feed because they're bored and are looking for something interesting but they haven't found it yet.

Ideally, I would like to couple time spent with a counter metric that measures a user's engagement in the content such as likes or creators followed from the Discover feed."

### Common Metrics Question Pitfalls

- **Answer the question asked.** If they asked for one north star metric, don't end up with three options due to indecision.
- **Make sure your answer is an actual metric.** Don't use "engagement" as your north star metric. Engagement is not a metric; it's a class of metrics. Specify what you actually want to measure (e.g., DAU, time spent, purchases).
- **Clarify how your metric is measured.** If your north star is DAU, what makes a user "active"? If the metric is time spent, is that per session? Per user per month?
- **Ensure your metric gives you useful information.** A small feature's effect on the whole product's DAU will likely be drowned out by noise, so overall DAU may not be useful for that feature.

### "Okay" vs. "Good" vs. "Great" Metrics Answers

**Okay answer:** Gives a broad explanation of what the goals of the product are. Lists feasible metrics with reasonable justification for choosing one as north star.

**Good answer:** Gives a clear sense of the product's goals based on reasonable insights. Explains what actions would show goals are being met, then finds metrics to measure those actions. Understands where metrics might be misleading and suggests guardrails.

**Great answer:** Finds deep understanding of the product and why it exists. Articulates specific goals that clearly communicate what's important. Has good sense of what they need to understand and can translate that into actions and metrics. North star metric justification feels deeply tied to the goal and larger organizational success.

### 5. Estimation Questions

Estimation questions are some of the most unusual questions you're likely to face. For example, an interviewer could ask you to estimate how many windows are in New York City. Not all companies ask estimation questions, but it's still a useful skill to have in your pocket.

The good news is that hiring managers aren't looking for perfect answers to these questions. What interests them is your approach to problem-solving.

**Examples of estimation questions:**
- "Estimate the number of Uber drivers needed in the San Francisco Bay Area"
- "How much does the Empire State Building weigh?"
- "How much does the Google Play store make in a year?"

**Framework:**
1. **Break down the problem** - What are the key components?
2. **State assumptions** - Be explicit about your reasoning
3. **Use benchmarks** - Upper/lower bounds, personal anecdotes for educated estimates
4. **Sanity check** - Does your answer make sense?

### 6. Technical Questions

Technical interview questions are no longer common in PM interviews. Still, they may pop up, depending on the company. Your recruiter will tell you whether you can expect one, so if you're unsure, ask your recruiter.

These questions focus on:
- The software development process
- Any specific technologies you'll work with at your target company
- The technical aspects of product development, including technical communication skills

Ultimately, your interviewer will evaluate your ability to communicate around and with engineering concepts. You don't have to "become an engineer" for technical PM questions — it's important to maintain your focus on the user experience.

**Examples of technical questions:**
- "What happens when you type a URL in the browser?"
- "How do autonomous vehicles work?"

### 7. Behavioral Questions

**Framework: STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**

Common questions and what they're really testing:

**"Tell me about a time you had to influence someone without authority"**
- *Testing: Leadership potential, communication skills*
- *Good answer: Focus on understanding their perspective first, finding mutual benefits, and persistent but respectful follow-up*

**"Describe a project where you had to work with ambiguous requirements"**
- *Testing: Comfort with uncertainty, problem-solving approach*
- *Good answer: Show how you clarified requirements through questions, research, and iteration*

**"Give an example of when you had to prioritize competing demands"**
- *Testing: Decision-making framework, trade-off analysis*
- *Good answer: Demonstrate clear criteria for prioritization (impact, effort, alignment with goals)*

**Preparation tip:** Have 5-7 stories ready that can be adapted to different behavioral questions. Include examples from work, school projects, side projects, and leadership roles.

### Common Interview Questions

**"What's your favorite product?"**
The favorite product question is one of the most common you'll face during PM interviews. Hiring managers aim to understand your thought process, product thinking, and your values.

When answering this question, keep these "Three P's" in mind:
- **Passion**: Choose a product you're passionate about and actually use
- **Perspective**: Share a nuanced perspective on the product
- **Personality**: Help reveal aspects of your personality through your choice

First explain why you chose your favorite product. What features or aspects did you find innovative or effective? How does it solve a specific problem, need, or pain point? Show product knowledge by explaining its position in its market and what makes it stand out from competitors.

**"Why do you want to work at this company?"**
The hiring processes at many tech companies today are very competitive. With hundreds of qualified candidates, it's important to differentiate yourself by showing genuine interest.

Be sure to communicate that you've done your research. Explain how you align with company values and goals and how you can add value. Explain what about the company interests you - their culture, mission, values - and how your skills and experience align with their current needs.

**"Tell me about yourself"**
This is a standard opening question in most interviews to break the ice. Summarize your background, skills, and qualifications concisely and relevant to the position. Highlight your most important experiences and emphasize strengths that align with job requirements. This question also allows you to showcase your personality and motivation for pursuing product management.

## Interview Technique Framework

Regardless of the question type, follow this systematic approach to deliver strong, structured answers:

### 1. Listen & Take Notes

This may seem obvious, but this is the most important part of the interview. Don't just listen, actively listen. Jot down notes as you hear the question for keywords or important points. Make frequent eye contact with the interviewer. Show interest and excitement to tackle the question.

### 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

Before answering the question, ask a question! No matter how straightforward the question seems, ask clarifying questions to understand the important details and your interviewer's expectations.

**Sample clarifying questions:**
- "Is this product scoped to a particular set of users?"
- "What platforms are our users on?"
- "Are we launching internationally or domestically?"
- "Ok, you're asking me to _____. Is that correct?"

Fundamentally, this step ensures you and your interviewer are on the same page.

### 3. Pause & Think

I know it's tempting to jump into an answer, and to be honest, most PM interview candidates are great talkers.

But stop. Don't speak yet.

As an interview coach, I notice huge increases in quality of product management interview answers when the interviewee pauses for even just 10–15 seconds to consider their approach. It may feel like your interviewer expects an immediate answer, but trust me — they'll appreciate it much more when you have a coherent and cogent response.

### 4. Structure Your Answer

After thinking, you'll need to deliver a structured answer to the question. Walk through your structure before answering.

**Pro tip:** This is a great opportunity to write the structure on the whiteboard as you speak.

The simplest structure is a three-point answer. Your intro sentence could be: "Ok, I'm going to cover three potential products that answer your question, and explain the tradeoffs of each. The three products are _____, _____, and _____."

Now, your interviewer has a sense of your answer's structure, and can redirect you as needed.

### 5. Explain

Here's the meat of the interview question. Dive into the details of your answer and explain your thought process. Depending on the interview question, you'll want to structure and present your answer differently.

Generally, make sure to sit tall, confidently explain your answer, and make eye contact. Use the whiteboard liberally — it's a great visual aid for your answer.

### 6. Pivot and Check-in

You may be mid-way through your answer when something goes wrong. Here are some possible pitfalls and how to pivot:

**Your interviewer gives concerned body language:** Based on your interviewer's posture or gesturing, it seems like perhaps you're not on the right track. Pause where appropriate and check in. "Ok, I've just answered the first part of my question. I'll now move on to the next segment of my answer. Is that alright?"

**You realize your answer is wrong:** This happens frequently. Midway through talking, you realize your answer is flawed in a fundamental way. Don't fret — this is really common during PM interviews! Depending on your personal style, figure out a smooth way to pivot mid-answer. For instance, "As I discuss this point, I realize that there are several flaws with my answer. I'd actually like to shift my answer a bit toward…."

**You forget your point:** Ideally, this wouldn't happen because you already defined a clear structure. However, if you blank out, don't worry. Nine times out of ten, you just need a bit more time to think about the answer, so ask for it. "Ok, I'll need a bit more time to think through the second part of my question. Please give me a few moments."

**Classic mistake:** Interviewees set up an awesome structure, but then somehow go completely off track and the interviewer is lost. Stick to your structure, or communicate your changes clearly if a change is necessary.

### 7. Summarize Your Answer

You're almost there! But there's one critical step left. In no longer than 30 seconds, reiterate what you've told your interviewer, using the same structure that you defined in step #4. "In summary, we've discussed ____, ____, and ____."

**Preparation tip:** Have 5-7 stories ready that can be adapted to different behavioral questions. Include examples from work, school projects, side projects, and leadership roles.

### 2. Product Sense Questions

These test your ability to think like a user and identify product opportunities.

**"How would you improve [existing product]?"**

**Framework:**
1. **Clarify the scope** - What specific aspect? Which user segment?
2. **Identify the user and their goals** - Who uses this and why?
3. **Analyze current pain points** - Where does the experience break down?
4. **Propose solutions** - Prioritize by impact and feasibility
5. **Define success metrics** - How would you measure improvement?

**"Design a product for [target user group]"**

**Framework:**
1. **Understand the user** - Demographics, behaviors, needs, pain points
2. **Define the problem** - What job are they hiring your product to do?
3. **Ideate solutions** - Multiple approaches, then converge
4. **Prioritize features** - MVP vs. future iterations
5. **Success metrics** - Both quantitative and qualitative

**Example walkthrough:**
"Design a fitness app for busy professionals"

1. **User research:** 25-40 year olds, work 50+ hours/week, want to stay healthy but struggle with time/consistency
2. **Core problem:** Limited time and unpredictable schedules make traditional fitness routines difficult
3. **Solution:** Micro-workout app with 5-15 minute sessions, adaptive to schedule/location
4. **Key features:** Quick workout library, calendar integration, progress tracking, social accountability
5. **Metrics:** Weekly active users, session completion rate, user retention

### 3. Analytical/Technical Questions

**Estimation questions:**
- "How many smartphones are sold globally each year?"
- "Estimate the market size for food delivery apps"

**Framework:**
1. **Break down the problem** - What are the key components?
2. **State assumptions** - Be explicit about your reasoning
3. **Sanity check** - Does your answer make sense?

**Data interpretation:**
- "Daily active users dropped 15% last month. How would you investigate?"

**Framework:**
1. **Clarify the metric** - How is DAU defined? What's the historical trend?
2. **Hypothesize causes** - External factors, product changes, technical issues, seasonality
3. **Prioritize investigation** - What would you check first and why?
4. **Define next steps** - How would you test your hypotheses?

### 4. Strategic Thinking

**"Should [Company X] enter [Market Y]?"**

**Framework:**
1. **Market analysis** - Size, growth, competitive landscape
2. **Company fit** - Core competencies, strategic alignment, resources
3. **Barriers and risks** - What could go wrong? How significant?
4. **Success requirements** - What would need to be true for this to work?
5. **Recommendation** - Clear yes/no with reasoning
