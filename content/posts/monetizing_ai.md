AI has attracted extraordinary investment, but the question of what consumers will actually pay for remains unsettled. Today’s monetization strategies—subscriptions like ChatGPT Plus or Kimi, API usage fees, and ad-driven AI applications—resemble the early internet era, where infrastructure outpaced clear consumer value. On the B2B side, AI often enhances existing workflows, such as creative generation in advertising, but rarely justifies direct pricing. Advertisers care less about model sophistication than about measurable outcomes—new creative material, better engagement, or lower cost per click. As a result, product value is abstracted into incremental revenue lift, not standalone payment. For consumers, subscription-based AI products work only when the perceived utility is personal, persistent, and irreplaceable—writing, coding, or tutoring assistants that feel indispensable.

Ultimately, AI monetization may hinge not on the intelligence itself but on its embodiment—how seamlessly it integrates into habits, tools, and ecosystems people already pay for. The next wave of value capture will likely come from domain-specific AI layers that own distribution (e.g., productivity, media, or commerce), rather than from general intelligence sold as a service.
