# Version History Test

This is the initial version of a test post to demonstrate the version history system.

## Key Points

- This is version 1.0
- When I update this post, the version history will appear below
- Readers can click to see exactly what changed

## How It Works

The git-based system means:
1. Each version is committed to git
2. The changelog appears at the bottom
3. Readers can view diffs and previous versions on GitHub
4. No file duplication needed
