Why We Need More Ways to Hear Customers
As product teams scale, direct exposure to customers narrows. We drift into a product → market pattern: build for a vocal few, iterate with them, and accumulate complexity that alienates everyone else. With agentic tools and tighter loops, we can flip to market → product: still partner closely with a subset of customers, but also listen more broadly, form grounded hypotheses from authentic needs, then decide what to build.

The AI Way to Do It
Traditional social listening tracks competitors and brand chatter. We extend it to enterprise product building. Beyond internal testers and formal channels, the internet already hosts rich, first-party signals about how products—ours and others—land in the wild: community forums, Q&A sites, GitHub issues, Reddit/HN threads, and support communities. If we capture, filter, and reason over that discourse responsibly, we get a truer view of pain points, expectations, and the language users actually use.

Practical workflow
1.Targeted discovery (for specific questions): compile a tight corpus from public discussions, extract and normalize text, then reason over it with a large-context LLM to label and synthesize themes.
2.Open-ended exploration (for fuzzy spaces): generate sentence/thread embeddings, cluster semantically, and label themes with short, evidence-linked summaries.

Every theme flows into a decision scaffold—theme → testable hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement—to prevent “insight theater.” Longer-term, run an always-on Customer Insight Radar that ingests external communities plus internal notes (with privacy filters), tracks theme velocity, and attaches representative quotes so PMs and engineers can feel the evidence behind the numbers.

Primary vs. secondary sources
Treat raw online discourse (posts, threads, issue comments) as primary research and polished content (blogs, vendor write-ups, SEO pages) as secondary. “Deep research” tools often paraphrase what’s indexed. We optimize for original insight, not summaries of summaries: go to the source, weight firsthand accounts more heavily, and use secondary material only for background or triangulation.

A Bit More on Embeddings (and Why They Help)
Embeddings convert messy text into dense vectors where closeness reflects meaning. Early static methods (skip-gram/CBOW, GloVe) learn one vector per word—fast and useful for clustering, but they blur senses (“bill” the invoice vs. “bill” the law). Contextual encoders produce different vectors for the same word depending on context and can be pooled to sentence/document embeddings.

For social listening, sentence/document embeddings are the workhorse: they enable semantic search (“unreconcilable line items” ↔ “can’t map charges to usage”), organic theme discovery without hand-built taxonomies, and drift tracking as language shifts. In practice, we embed at sentence and thread granularity, use ANN indexing for retrieval, and favor density-based or hierarchical clustering to fit the uneven shape of real discussions—always anchoring themes to verbatim quotes for auditability.

Reasoning Models and Visualizations
With smaller datasets, we can directly provide the extracted raw text to a large-context, strong-reasoning model. This goes beyond coarse sentiment categories or word clouds, enabling richer context and actionable insights. Curated prompts let an LLM (or agent) read the semantic neighborhoods, surface key themes, note counter-signals, and propose testable hypotheses.

What the output is—and isn’t
The output isn’t a slide; it’s a decision input. Each synthesized theme should map to a testable product hypothesis, an opportunity-size signal, and an instrumentation plan—the same scaffold above that keeps the loop tight.

Seeing It in Action

Example 1: The Cost Experience
From ~700 candidate threads, we curated ~100 high-signal discussions (Reddit, HN, Quora, vendor/community forums), normalized text, embedded at sentence/thread level, clustered themes, and linked each to example quotes. One dominant signal emerged: billing complexity and transparency drive most cost-related UX pain. Users struggle to reconcile invoices to usage, discover overruns after month-end, and use calculators that ignore dynamic workloads—leading to surprise spikes. Strategically, users prefer predictable costs over merely lower costs. The advantage is cost-experience design (real-time transparency, proactive controls, behavior-aware forecasting) rather than discounts alone. Platform “flavors” vary (e.g., BigQuery pricing confusion, Snowflake credit visibility, Databricks cluster trade-offs, Splunk ingestion spikes, Redshift monitoring blind spots), but the design response is consistent: plain-English cost impact at point of action, pre-threshold alerts, safe throttles, and workload-aware forecasting.


Example 2: Tier-2 SOC Analyst Friction
Across tools, five universal barriers appear:
1.query language/parsing complexity;
2.false-positive overload;
3.correlation/integration hurdles across silos;
4.workflow friction from context switching and ad-hoc processes;
5.platform limitations that pull analysts into tool troubleshooting.

Design mandate: lower technical barriers, suppress noise, preserve investigative context, and streamline common paths so analysts spend time on threats—not tool mechanics. Agentic experiences and stronger defaults move the needle fastest.

Crowdlistening



As shown in the cost-estimation agent presentation, Crowdlistening is a tool I built to extract patterns from collective discourse without flattening individual voices. It pairs LLM reasoning with a larger-context pipeline to ingest public discussions, structure them, and tie findings back to evidence. At its core, Crowdlistening treats raw discourse as primary data, emphasizes traceability (“show your work”), and optimizes for original insight over derivative summaries.

Crowdlistening's goal isn't forced consensus; it's to surface authentic needs, native customer language, and edge cases that formal channels miss. At Microsoft scale—where the user base is large and diverse—listening broadly helps us prioritize what's real over what's merely loud. (More background at Crowdlistening.com.)



Since the launch of MCPs, I've experimented with exposing Crowdlistening capabilities as MCP servers—directly accessible in clients like Copilot or Claude. Features remain similar (with some visualization limits), but inputs become more nuanced and multi-turn, making the experience far more intuitive for non-technical users.

## Building This at Microsoft

### A Feature Proposal
To enable the market → product workflow (listen broadly → form grounded hypotheses → decide what to build), we can ship a Copilot MCP integration as a conversational guide for early spec writing. It would:
- Ingest customer meeting transcripts and selected online discussions,
- Run evidence-linked synthesis with clear citations to primary sources,
- Produce theme → hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement scaffolds that slot directly into specs.

### Governance and Guardrails
Social data is messy and sensitive. We will:
- Apply strict sourcing, deduplication, and consent practices; avoid PII capture.
- Measure representativeness to reduce sampling bias.
- Link every synthesized claim to auditable evidence ("show your work").
- Use MCP-based connectors so data plumbing remains inspectable and secure.

## Closing Thought
AI-enabled social listening doesn’t replace customer calls, design research, or telemetry; it enriches them—especially at the fuzzy front end. Used well, it helps us choose better problems, write crisper specs, and ship experiences that feel obvious in hindsight.
