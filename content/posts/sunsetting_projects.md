## Opportunity Costs

It isn't easy when you find out a product you've put your heart, sweat, and tears into isn't working out. I also know that startups operate in a constant state of ambiguity and sometimes you don't see light at the end of the tunnel when you've already toiled at it for what seems like an eternity, sometimes there is no light.  I've heard the phrase "Take more market risk when you are young, and more execution risk when you are older". From what I understand, the former states that for people early in their career, it's okay to bet on markets and opportunities, even if these could seem contrarian. I quote this because I've recently been thinking about how to best allocate my time and energy on the most promising projects. This is not a matter of spreading eggs in different baskets - I acknowledge I have a very limited attention span and doing everything simultaneously will lead to burn out and less than satisfactory results. Thus - why I'm writing this post, as an attempt to provide more clarity.

As AI tools mature, I've gotten a lot faster at shipping products. However, this does not necessarily mean everyone of them will work out. Over the past two years I've shipped a total of 5 products (Launched): Cogno (Cognogpt.com), Marrrket (Marrrket.com), Crowdlistening (Crowdlistening.com), A2A Catalog (a2acatalog.com). I also helped ship 3 0-1 products: Symphony Assistant (https://ads.tiktok.com/business/copilot/standalone), Insights Spotlight (https://ads.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/insights-spotlight-trends-tool), and Aibrary (aibrary.ai). Among these products, some worked, while some didn't. For disclosure purposes, I will only discuss about the ones I directly led. I expect this post to remain as some what of a ramble for the near term as I reason more about this and more data points appear. 

Marketing matters (a lot). Yet for a product to succeed, one would need to find a way to actually convert this traffic into revenue. Amidst the AI hype, one way to stand out within undifferentiated products is via controversy and viral marketing (Cluely). While we await for the Cluely case to play out, crowdtest.ai is a case we can look in hindsight (https://www.crowdtest.ai/). Founded by a Freshman with a large twitter following, Crowdtest.ai boasted to have reached 30k in revenue within 24 hours of launch (with generous refund policies). It did have ~ 1500 MAU two months ago when I checked, however the stats have fallen since then. This was not a success. The value proposition was not clear - who is willing to pay $100 to optimize their twitter posts? Does AI actually do a better job at this?

I note this because I replicated this for the predict feature of Crowdlistening (https://crowdlistening.com/predict), looking at a16z's social simulation investment thesis. It would definitely be cool to have a group of agents serve as testing ground for new ideas, but there's just a lot of unconfirmed hypothesis - Agents are likely generalizations of language (arguably humans as crowds also are), who would be willing to pay for such a service? Not my proudest feature ship, but a good experience none the less. Lesson: (1) get a large twitter following, (2) take all marketing with a grain of salt, the data speaks truths. 

## Early Catalog Products 

An app store for this, an app store for that. FlowGPT was one of the successes of 2022, an early Discord community transformed into a digital catalog of prompts, and now perhaps agent experiences? The last time I checked they still have an upward of two million monthly active users, an impressive feat. Timing was crucial here, it was a good product, early on in the game, sufficient factors for it's success (monetization unsure). It'd be a lot harder to build such a product now given just how much has been created since the advent of ChatGPT in November of 2022. Or is it? With new agent protocols like MCP Servers and A2A Agents. 

The idea of building a catalog for A2A Agents (and subsequently MCP Servers) originated from a random spree for domain name browsing. I was looking for high value domain names related to MCPs - thinking they would be valuable if they were here to stay. It turned out that all the good mcp domain names were taken. What's the next best alternative? A2A Agents seemed promising. The intuition was that (1) .com domain names were still the most valuable (2) I know I could do decently well in compiling the largest list of A2A Agents on the web, and (3) It would be easier to add MCP Servers than it is to add A2A Agents, given Agent > Tool. As of writing this, these two hypothesis still hold to be true. However, I underestimated the scale and pace of competitors. There has been at least 5 catalog websites I've seen thus far, and although they don't have as nice of a domain name, I have to say they've also done a pretty good job at compiling the list. 

This is still an ongoing project, but I'll still be completly transparent in my thought process for reasoning about competition. Addressing the three intuitions, I have to make certain additional notes: (1)Although the a2acatalog.com domain name is great, it alone is not enough to capture and retain users - a combination of aggressive SEO optimization and Blog writing is needed (I'm still improving in this area so I wouldn't say I have an edge yet) other channels - tiktok, reddit, twitter seemed less ideal (this wasn't going to be viral content), (2) It's true that I could easily compile lists of A2A Agents and MCP Servers, but so could competitors, if there's enough profit to be made here, I could easily see poeple crawling catalogs and moving the content to their pages. Differentiation should be either in the ease of use / automatic deployment side for less tech savy users, or hyper personalization for savy users, (3) Yes, I could add MCP servers too, but it's slightly too early to develop some sort of more lasting moat, connecting to the second point.

Two things I'm curious about, what differentiates existing catalog products. I've seen websites with more than 150k in web traffic, however the revenue model is likely not ideal. For my own product (a2acatalog.com) or any product that I ship, the hope is that they either reach the most amount of people possible, or are in a niche vertical that allows me to have absolute dominance and consistently procure small revenue streams from it. For the latter, I would need to go into a verticle with marketing potential - not as a general purpose platform, but serving concrete user needs. For the former, I'm still a ways to go. 

![Geographic Distribution](/images/posts/sunsetting_projects/geo_distribution.png)
*Geographic distribution of catalog users*

Work in progress, thought in process. 6.25 I think drawing from the list of sunsetted products (aka failed experiences), nearly each of them had to do with failure to gain traction in customer acquisition. This is interesting. From what I've seen with successful products launches, the best product doesn't always win, the distribution channel wins. Perhaps I should shift gears to focusing more on developing distribution channels, and subsequently, products as a medium to capture this traffic? 

Early Products in General 

Recently I briefly surveyed the list of agent products. People still seemed to be building the same things - multi-agent system for this, agentic experience for that. As the market has become more open to agents as potential employees compared to 2022, when they were still largely chatbots, I stop to whether there were anything I should have continued on, and whether there could still be ways of quickly testing these ideas to guage and advance my understanding in the space. 

[ Reusing a Previous Blog Post] Reflecting on 2024 (and 2023 for the context of Cogno), among my list of failed projects, very few failed due to lack of innovation. Since I began working with LLMs in fall 2022, there has been an abundance of interesting GenAI technologies to experiment with. It started with “domain specific prompting/finetuning” and data flywheels (thou not even now does anyone know what this looks like in action). By spring 2023, the focus shifted to LLMs as agents, exemplified by the Generative Agents paper, Microsoft AutoGen, and a few opensource projects like MetaGPT. At Cogno, we also built multi-agent systems, integrating various function calling features and agent collaboration for complex task reasoning. Everyone built, few created value (Glean focused on enterprise search, while Moveworks created value through api actions, neither of which I believe agents to have mattered). Founders encouraged each other’s enthusiasm, while investors rushed to learn the latest buzzwords in LLM technology (‘prompt engineering’ and ‘function calls’ sounded less sexy compared to’agents’).

Being first to market rarely matters - people won’t remember you. What matters is creating defensible moats or developing critical elements that lead to unfair advantages. While Google’s technology investment in Android can be considered ’not just building a moat, but scorching the earth for 250 miles around the castle,’ most companies’ self-described technological differentiation is merely self-flattery and a feeble attempt to impress tech-enthusiast investors. Technology truly matters only when it can solve seemingly insurmountable challenges or optimize costs and operations. In every other situation, the focus should be on building sustainable advantages that ensure long-term survival. [Thoughts WIP]

Thoughts Going Forward
I like the idea of monetizing results. We started at tokens (Chat Products) - how many words an LLM could output, then shifted to conversations (Copilot) as the quality of intent interpretation and generation improved. Next, could we charge based on results? I know Exa and Sierra are already proposing it, yet there's still much to be improved - what if there are no results from a query that has a lot of filters? The (extensive?) compute goes uncharged, is this a good business model? Same with MCPs and A2As, if you are not the provider of an agent, when a user engages with an agent via a client they've built, who gets paid? I think there is an interesting market system to be built here. WIP
