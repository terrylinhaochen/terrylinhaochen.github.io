## Understanding the Business of Search Ads

Work in progress for understanding the search ads business.

### Defining the Business
Search ads appear on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) for keyword queries, part of Pay-Per-Click (PPC) marketing. Ads display based on bids, at top/bottom of results or alongside organics. This auction model uses bid, quality, and relevance for placement. It connects advertisers to high-intent users, charging per click for engagement-based efficiency.

#### Advertisements
Text ads include headlines, descriptions, site links; extensions add calls or locations. Formats like shopping ads feature images/prices. Revenue efficiency uses Click-Through Rate (CTR) (impressions to clicks), Cost Per Click (CPC) (cost per click), Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) (revenue/ad spend). High CTR (e.g., 6% in dating) shows relevance; ROAS >4:1 signals e-commerce success. Metrics guide optimization for lower costs, higher conversions.
