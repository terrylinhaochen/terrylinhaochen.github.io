Building Agentic Workflows From LLMs to Agents The transition from LLMs to Agents has become a consensus in the AI community, representing an improvement in complex task execution capabilities. However, helping users fully utilize Agent capabilities to achieve tenfold efficiency gains requires careful workflow design. These workflows aren’t merely a presentation of parallel capabilities, but seamless integrations with human-in-the-loop quality assurance. This document uses Typeface as a reference to explain why a clear primary workflow is necessary, as well as design approaches for functional extensions.

The platform aims to solve the inefficiency in the current second-hand market by simplifying the listing process through AI-generated product descriptions from images and minimal user input. By reducing friction in the listing process, Marrrket will increase the overall volume of second-hand items available in the market, creating a more efficient marketplace for both buyers and sellers. The platform’s innovation centers on using artificial intelligence to dramatically lower the barrier to entry for sellers, which is hypothesized to be the primary constraint on market growth.

Abstract Despite advances in large language model (LLM) capability, their fundamental limitation of not being able to store context over long-lived interactions persists. In this paper, a novel human-inspired three-tiered memory architecture is presented that addresses these limitations through biomimetic design principles rooted in cognitive science. Our approach aligns the human working memory with the LLM context window, episodic memory with vector stores of experience-based knowledge, and semantic memory with structured knowledge triplets.

Abstract Effective coaching in project-based learning environments is critical for developing students’ self-regulation skills, yet scaling high-quality coaching remains a challenge. This paper presents an LLM-enhanced coaching system designed to support project-based learning by helping connect peers struggling with the same regulation gap, and to help coaches by identifying regulation gaps and generating tailored practice suggestions. Our system integrates vector-based semantic matching with LLM-generated regulation gap categorizations for Context Assessment Plan (CAP) notes. Results demonstrate that our system effectively retrieves relevant coaching cases, reducing the cognitive burden on mentors while maintaining high-quality, context-aware feedback.
