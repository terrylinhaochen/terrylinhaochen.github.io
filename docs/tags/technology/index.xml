&lt;p>Usable AI agents are finally here from deep research platforms out of OpenAI and Google to similar tools from XAI and DeepSeek. Joining the competition now is Manus, a brand new agentic AI platform that has taken the world by storm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Craft of Miyazaki in an AI-Generated World</title><link>https://chenterry.com/posts/craft-miyakazi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/posts/craft-miyakazi/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Dust Balls" loading="lazy" src="https://chenterry.com/images/posts/hayao-miyakazi/dust-balls.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hayao Miyazaki is my favorite artist and director. Though I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched his entire filmography, every moment of the films I have seen captivates me. In &amp;ldquo;Spirited Away,&amp;rdquo; the dust ball creatures exemplify his artistic prowess—his ability to infuse life into the mundane through his drawings. His work is truly a labor of love. Every scene in his animated films is hand-drawn and painted with watercolor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To put this dedication in perspective: a single &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/1egdzja/this_4_second_crowd_scene_from_studio_ghiblis/">4 second crowd scene&lt;/a> from Studio Ghibli required 1 year and 3 months to complete. At 24 frames per second, that&amp;rsquo;s 96 images—roughly 6.4 images per month or one-third of an image in an eight-hour workday. At this rate, animators would spend a decade creating just 28.8 seconds of footage. This extraordinary commitment to craft has established Miyazaki&amp;rsquo;s work as iconic for decades.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smart Expense Tracker</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/smart-expense-tracker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/smart-expense-tracker/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Smart Expense Tracker with Auto-Categorization is a cloud-native application built on AWS serverless architecture.

&lt;p>Crowdlistening transforms large-scale social conversations into actionable insight by integrating llm reasoning with extensive model context protocol(MCP) capabilities. Our focus is not just on analyzing content at scale, but rather conducting original research directly from raw social data, generating insights that haven&amp;rsquo;t yet appeared in established reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deep research features provide professional-looking research reports, yet the contents are far from original, as they&amp;rsquo;re drawn from articles already indexable on the internet and paraphrased with LLMs. However, much of the internet&amp;rsquo;s data exists in unstructured formats - TikTok videos, comments, and metadata, for example. Too much content is generated every day for there to be existing articles written about it all, and when such articles are published, they&amp;rsquo;re often already outdated. When you consider multimodal data, metadata, and connections between data points, these are precisely the types of information that could yield genuinely interesting and useful insights.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rapid Prototyping of LLM Enabled Webapps</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/prototyping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/prototyping/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="peptalk-ai-journaling-tool">PepTalk: AI Journaling Tool&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The transition from LLMs to Agents has become a consensus in the AI community, representing an improvement in complex task execution capabilities. However, helping users fully utilize Agent capabilities to achieve tenfold efficiency gains requires careful workflow design. These workflows aren&amp;rsquo;t merely a presentation of parallel capabilities, but seamless integrations with human-in-the-loop quality assurance. This document uses Typeface as a reference to explain why a clear primary workflow is necessary, as well as design approaches for functional extensions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marrrket: AI Listing Secondhand Marketplace</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/marrrket/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/marrrket/</guid><description>&lt;p>Marrrket is an AI-powered second-hand marketplace platform targeting North American university students, initially focusing on Chinese international students. The platform aims to solve the inefficiency in the current second-hand market by simplifying the listing process through AI-generated product descriptions from images and minimal user input. By reducing friction in the listing process, Marrrket will increase the overall volume of second-hand items available in the market, creating a more efficient marketplace for both buyers and sellers. The platform&amp;rsquo;s innovation centers on using artificial intelligence to dramatically lower the barrier to entry for sellers, which is hypothesized to be the primary constraint on market growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cogno: Multi-agent AI for sales automation</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/cogno/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/cogno/</guid><description>&lt;p>Multi-agent system for cross boarder e-commerce sales automation.

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Despite advances in large language model (LLM) capability, their fundamental limitation of not being able to store context over long-lived interactions persists. In this paper, a novel human-inspired three-tiered memory architecture is presented that addresses these limitations through biomimetic design principles rooted in cognitive science. Our approach aligns the human working memory with the LLM context window, episodic memory with vector stores of experience-based knowledge, and semantic memory with structured knowledge triplets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving &amp; Scaling LLMs for Coaching</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/improving-scaling-llms-coaching/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/improving-scaling-llms-coaching/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="situated-practice-systems-improving-and-scaling-coaching-through-llms">Situated Practice Systems: Improving and Scaling Coaching through LLMs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Authors: Terry Chen, Allyson Lee&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Effective coaching in project-based learning environments is critical for developing students&amp;rsquo; self-regulation skills, yet scaling high-quality coaching remains a challenge. This paper presents an LLM-enhanced coaching system designed to support project-based learning by helping connect peers struggling with the same regulation gap, and to help coaches by identifying regulation gaps and generating tailored practice suggestions. Our system integrates vector-based semantic matching with LLM-generated regulation gap categorizations for Context Assessment Plan (CAP) notes. Results demonstrate that our system effectively retrieves relevant coaching cases, reducing the cognitive burden on mentors while maintaining high-quality, context-aware feedback.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
