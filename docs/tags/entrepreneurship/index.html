Smaller and More Efficient Teams When should we hire a person versus delegating to AI? Recently I’ve been more reluctant towards hiring people as an attempt to build mid sized projects. Yes, the codebases would get pretty big, and there’s also tasks involved that I wouldn’t say are my forte exactly. Yet, when I think about the meetings I have to sit through communicating what I want to build and just time spent doing filler work, I get more and more inclined towards just doing it myself. It’s not to say that teamwork isn’t good work, some of the most creative product ideas I’ve worked on stemmed from chats, during lunch breaks, exploring tangents, with engineers, journalists. The value of connecting the dots during these conversations is something that is difficult to replace. However, is the assumption that delegating work means higher productivity still valid? After all, the cost of execution is continually decreasing (as long as we have a clear idea of what to build).

They’d probably have something substantial to talk about. While I don’t usually go to bars during weekdays, I’ve found some similar ways of identifying user needs, mostly through conversations or online forums. This is a running document of the user needs or pain points that I’ve found to be interesting. Perhaps some of them will turn out to be viable business oppportunities.

(crowdlistening.com) From Content Aggregation to Original Research Crowdlistening transforms large-scale social conversations into actionable insight by integrating llm reasoning with extensive model context protocol(MCP) capabilities. Our focus is not just on analyzing content at scale, but rather conducting original research directly from raw social data, generating insights that haven’t yet appeared in established reporting.
Deep research features provide professional-looking research reports, yet the contents are far from original, as they’re drawn from articles already indexable on the internet and paraphrased with LLMs. However, much of the internet’s data exists in unstructured formats - TikTok videos, comments, and metadata, for example. Too much content is generated every day for there to be existing articles written about it all, and when such articles are published, they’re often already outdated. When you consider multimodal data, metadata, and connections between data points, these are precisely the types of information that could yield genuinely interesting and useful insights.

Rather than focusing solely on my own projects, I’d like to explore the foundational aspects of AI product design, interspersing examples from my recent work. First, I want to emphasize that technology is merely a tool intended to better serve business needs. If it doesn’t significantly improve efficiency, traditional methods may be more appropriate. Second, despite the many imaginative possibilities of current technology, applications should ultimately be guided by user needs. Finally, AI technologies and markets evolve rapidly, making predictions difficult to validate, but exploring content understanding and generation remains an intriguing challenge.
