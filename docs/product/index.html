        <h1 id="from-indexing-to-understanding-intent-in-discovery-systems">From Indexing to Understanding Intent in Discovery Systems</h1>
<p>Discovery is moving from static data retrieval toward systems that understand why a user is searching, not just what they type. The next generation of search experiences must merge precise recall with adaptive reasoning—delivering fast, contextually relevant answers while offering deeper AI-powered synthesis when users explore unfamiliar or complex topics.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-traditional-search-falls-short">Why Traditional Search Falls Short</h2>
<p>Traditional keyword search works best when the user knows exactly what to ask. However, most discovery today begins with uncertainty: a half-remembered quote, a general theme, or a desire for inspiration. Users often don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re looking for until they see it. The problem is both cognitive and technical—users&rsquo; mental models evolve as they explore. Modern discovery tools must anticipate that evolution, interpret vague intent, and surface meaningfully related ideas rather than exact word matches.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="from-indexing-to-intent-based-query-completion">From Indexing to Intent-Based Query Completion</h2>
<p>The transition from indexing to intent-driven discovery mirrors a broader movement from databases that store information to systems that reason about context. In practice, this takes two complementary forms: <em>fast responses</em> and <em>deep responses</em>.</p>
<p>Fast responses are built for immediate clarity. They combine multiple recall routes—lexical, semantic, behavioral, and social—to provide accurate answers quickly. This approach excels in known-item retrieval and factual questions. For instance, <strong>Fable&rsquo;s new search experience</strong> goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand emotional and stylistic dimensions. When a reader searches &ldquo;books that feel like autumn evenings,&rdquo; the system infers ambience and tone rather than relying solely on metadata tags. This design transforms search from literal matching to contextual association.</p>

<em>Fable&rsquo;s enhanced search showing predictive completion for incomplete queries like &ldquo;heaven and earth g&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The system demonstrates superior intent understanding by providing relevant suggestions before users complete their queries. The &ldquo;After&rdquo; version shows how modern search anticipates user needs, surfacing &ldquo;The Heaven &amp; Earth Grocery Store&rdquo; and related titles when users type partial queries.</p>

<em>Fable&rsquo;s improved relevance matching for author searches like &ldquo;james&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Similarly, when searching for &ldquo;james,&rdquo; the enhanced system prioritizes contextually relevant results like &ldquo;James (Pulitzer Prize Winner)&rdquo; rather than generic matches, demonstrating how intent-aware systems understand query context.</p>
<p>Deep responses, in contrast, serve users exploring open-ended questions. They rely on large language models to synthesize information, drawing connections across content sources and explaining the reasoning behind conclusions. <strong>Red (Xiaohongshu)</strong> offers a compelling example through its <em>AskNow</em> feature, where AI-generated insights are grounded on verified community posts, maintaining both authenticity and transparency. Similarly, <strong>Reddit Answers</strong> (currently in beta) uses real user discussions as evidence for its responses, ensuring that generated insights remain rooted in human context rather than abstract data patterns.</p>

<em>Red&rsquo;s AskNow feature providing AI-generated company analysis with structured insights on market competition, privacy policies, and legal disputes</em></p>
<p>The AskNow interface demonstrates sophisticated content synthesis, taking user queries about companies like AppLovin and generating comprehensive analyses that include market positioning (competition with Meta, Google), regulatory challenges (privacy policies like IDFA), and risk factors (legal disputes affecting stock prices)—all grounded in community discussions rather than abstract data.</p>
<p>This dual architecture—fast for confidence, deep for curiosity—captures how systems can dynamically adapt to user intent during a single session.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-two-loop-discovery-engine">The Two-Loop Discovery Engine</h2>
<p>Intent-aware systems operate through a continuous feedback structure combining retrieval and reasoning. The retrieval loop aggregates relevant results using hybrid signals such as keyword relevance, vector similarity, and recency. The reasoning loop interprets ongoing behavior—clicks, refinements, and skips—to update an <em>Intent State</em> that guides subsequent outputs. Each iteration yields one of three outcomes: a direct answer, a curated content set, or an AI-generated synthesis.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="design-principles-for-intent-aware-search">Design Principles for Intent-Aware Search</h2>
<p>An effective discovery system prioritizes clarity, adaptability, and transparency. Each result should show why it was retrieved—through cues such as &ldquo;popular in similar sessions&rdquo; or &ldquo;matches your theme and tone.&rdquo; Systems should learn within each session, refining their understanding as the user interacts. They must balance novelty with relevance, maintaining an exploratory rhythm without overwhelming the user. Transparency matters most: showing data sources, confidence levels, and offering manual control over personalization builds long-term trust. Lastly, discovery should feel seamless across formats—books, posts, videos, and conversations—as part of a single cognitive journey.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="when-the-corpus-falls-short">When the Corpus Falls Short</h2>
<p>An intent-aware system recognizes when no direct answer exists. Instead of ending in failure, it synthesizes a grounded response that discloses its sources and confidence level. These generated insights transform information gaps into moments of learning—highlighting missing viewpoints, summarizing scattered data, or surfacing counterexamples that broaden understanding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="measuring-success-through-comprehension">Measuring Success Through Comprehension</h2>
<p>Success in intent-based discovery extends beyond engagement metrics. Systems should measure <strong>Time to Insight (TTI)</strong> to understand how quickly users reach clarity, <strong>Exploration Depth</strong> to gauge how broadly users traverse concepts, and <strong>Trust Indicators</strong> reflecting how often users expand citations or rely on AI explanations. Another key metric, <strong>Intent Alignment</strong>, measures how closely the system&rsquo;s inferred goal matches the user&rsquo;s evolving intent. These metrics move focus from clicks to comprehension, rewarding designs that help people think more efficiently.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-intent-awareness-matters">Why Intent Awareness Matters</h2>
<p>Search and recommendation are converging into a unified discipline focused on <em>intent understanding</em>. Platforms like Fable, Red, and Reddit show how discovery is shifting from indexing content to interpreting context. The future of search will belong to systems that bridge speed and synthesis—those that recognize a user&rsquo;s goal, respond in real time, and expand understanding with each interaction.</p>

      <h2>When Knowledge Becomes Fluid: How AI Transforms Learning</h2>
      <p class="project-meta">October 26, 2025</p>
      <div class="modal-content">
        <h1 id="when-knowledge-becomes-fluid">When Knowledge Becomes Fluid</h1>
<p>For most of history, knowledge has been bound — fixed in books, trapped in formats, and constrained by how it could be consumed. You could read a page, listen to a lecture, or watch a documentary, but each existed in isolation. With generative models, that boundary begins to dissolve. Knowledge itself becomes fluid — able to reshape, reframe, and re-express itself across contexts and mediums.</p>
<p>Distilling and communicating ideas is now easier and more capable than ever. What once required manual summarization and editing can now be synthesized in real time. A single idea can expand into many forms: a summary for clarity, a dialogue for perspective, a visual story for intuition. Instead of treating knowledge as static, we can begin to design it as something alive — capable of adapting to how, when, and where we learn.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="scaling-knowledge">Scaling Knowledge</h2>
<p>Most modern learning apps do a good job of compressing information, but they still rely on manual curation. Platforms like Blinkist summarize a few thousand books, turning complex ideas into short, digestible snippets. Useful, but limited. With large language models, we can go far beyond that. We can synthesize millions of books, using public-domain sources and model-based abstraction to avoid infringement while expanding reach.</p>
<p>Imagine a content pipeline that can transform any text into multiple formats — summaries, debates, timelines, or storyboards — automatically. This isn&rsquo;t just about quantity; it&rsquo;s about accessibility. Anyone could instantly learn from any book ever written, reformatted into whatever experience fits their context best. The scale of knowledge expands not by adding editors, but by giving knowledge itself the ability to self-express.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="fluid-learning">Fluid Learning</h2>
<p>Learning is deeply contextual. Reading a dense essay might work at a desk, but not while commuting or cooking. The same knowledge can take different forms depending on where we are and what we&rsquo;re doing. Generative models make this flexibility possible. A book chapter can transform into a short podcast for a train ride, a video summary during a break, or an interactive chat when you want to explore ideas more deeply.</p>
<p>When the system understands context — the time of day, the device, your focus level, or even your past learning behavior — it can dynamically serve the right modality for the moment. Instead of forcing you to adapt to the medium, the medium adapts to you. The result is a more continuous, natural learning flow — where engagement and retention rise because the format matches your state of mind.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="connecting-ideas">Connecting Ideas</h2>
<p>The next step is not just summarizing knowledge, but connecting it. A truly generative library doesn&rsquo;t only compress information — it discovers relationships. It can find the echoes that cut across books, fields, and centuries. It might reveal that The Art of War and Measure What Matters both explore alignment under uncertainty — one in ancient warfare, the other in modern management.</p>
<p>This kind of synthesis transforms learning from retrieval to insight. Instead of static archives, we begin to build creative constellations of ideas. Knowledge becomes something that grows through its connections, not just its content. We move from consuming isolated summaries to experiencing patterns of thought that evolve as we explore them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interactive-understanding">Interactive Understanding</h2>
<p>Summaries can tell you what to think, but they rarely teach you how to think. A new generation of learning systems can make that process interactive. Rather than passively reading, you engage with structured knowledge cards — each guiding you through definition, context, application, reflection, and connection. You can ask questions, compare ideas, and trace how concepts evolve across books.</p>
<p>Over time, these systems learn from your curiosity. If you&rsquo;ve been exploring Stoicism, they might suggest how its ideas overlap with Taoism or cognitive psychology. The experience becomes conversational — a collaboration between human intuition and machine reasoning. Learning feels less like consumption and more like construction, where understanding is built, not delivered.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-living-medium">A Living Medium</h2>
<p>Generative AI changes what a book even is. It turns knowledge into a living medium — fluid, adaptive, and co-creative. Instead of locking ideas into fixed containers, we can let them flow. A book becomes a conversation, a lecture becomes an experience, and learning becomes something that moves with us.</p>
<p>When knowledge becomes fluid, understanding no longer depends on how much we can read or memorize. It depends on how well our tools can help ideas move — across contexts, across formats, and ultimately, across minds.</p>

 </p>
<h2 id="from-content-aggregation-to-original-research">From Content Aggregation to Original Research</h2>
<p>Crowdlistening transforms large-scale social conversations into actionable insight by integrating llm reasoning with extensive model context protocol(MCP) capabilities. While being able to quantatively analyze large volumes of data is already an interesting task, our focus is not just on content analysis at scale, but rather conducting original research directly from raw social data, generating insights that haven&rsquo;t yet appeared in established reporting.</p>
<p>Deep research features provide professional-looking research reports, yet the contents are far from original, as they&rsquo;re drawn from articles already indexable on the internet and paraphrased with LLMs. However, much of the internet&rsquo;s data exists in unstructured formats - TikTok videos, comments, and metadata, for example. Too much content is generated every day for there to be existing articles written about it all, and when such articles are published, they&rsquo;re often already outdated. When you consider multimodal data, metadata, and connections between data points, these are precisely the types of information that could yield genuinely interesting and useful insights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this problem while working at TikTok, enabling better social listening through more fine-grained insights extracted using multi-modal/LLM-based approaches. In October, I started developing early conceptions of Crowdlistening, focusing on multi-modal content understanding for TikTok videos. Although deep research features like GPT Researcher and Stanford Oval Storm existed, it wasn&rsquo;t intuitive to integrate unstructured data processing capabilities into their workflows.</p>
<p>I paused Crowdlistening in Winter Quarter due to other commitments, but during this time, Anthropic released the Model Context Protocol (MCP). I&rsquo;ve recently gotten back on track following progress in this field, and I believe this presents an interesting avenue for product innovation - deep research features are significantly enhanced by the growing ecosystem of MCP servers (the same agentic workflows perform much better given they rely on APIs, whose capabilities have improved over recent months).</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m particularly interested in exploring and building with Crowdlistening is the ability to extract actionable insights from large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, forming linkages, and perhaps even testing hypotheses to enable effective research at scale. We started with TikTok data as a prototype ground given my familiarity with the medium, but I could quickly see this covering any type of unstructured data available on the web.</p>
<h2 id="the-insight-paradox">The Insight Paradox</h2>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/insight_paradox.png" alt="Insight Paradox" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>Brands today face a fundamental paradox: they need broad insights from vast amounts of social data, yet require the detailed understanding typically only available through limited case studies. Current solutions offer either abstracted metrics that require tedious manual interpretation, expensive and limited content screening that can&rsquo;t scale, or surface-level sentiment analysis that misses nuanced opinions. Crowdlistening bridges this gap by combining the scale of algorithmic analysis with the depth of human-like comprehension. This addresses the first challenge identified in &ldquo;Essence of Creativity&rdquo; - helping users understand massive amounts of information and generate meaningful insights when they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know what output they want.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="technical-architecture-multi-modal-by-design">Technical Architecture: Multi-Modal by Design</h2>
<p>The rationale behind Crowdlistening&rsquo;s multi-modal technical architecture stems from the fundamental challenge of extracting truly valuable insights from the vast and varied landscape of online conversations. Traditional methods often fall short because they either focus on structured data or analyze individual modalities (text, video, audio) in isolation. This approach misses the rich context and nuanced understanding that arises from the interplay between different forms of content and engagement. For example, a viral TikTok video&rsquo;s impact is not solely determined by its visual content but also by its accompanying audio, captions, user comments, and engagement metrics like likes and shares.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/analysis_page.png" alt="Analysis Page" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>Crowdlistening&rsquo;s design directly tackles this limitation by integrating embedding-based topic modeling and LLM deep research capabilities to process and understand this multi-faceted data. Embedding-based topic modeling efficiently identifies key themes across massive datasets, while the LLM&rsquo;s deep reasoning capabilities can then analyze these themes within the context of various modalities.</p>
<p>This dual approach allows for a layered analysis, examining both the primary content and the subsequent engagement it generates. By processing video, audio, text, and engagement metrics in a unified system, Crowdlistening can generate insights that reflect not just what is being said, but how it&rsquo;s being said, the surrounding context, and the audience&rsquo;s multifaceted response. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for overcoming the &ldquo;insight paradox&rdquo; and delivering truly actionable intelligence that goes beyond surface-level sentiment or abstracted metrics. Ultimately, this multi-modal design is essential for achieving the core goal of Crowdlistening: to conduct original research directly from raw social data and uncover emerging trends and nuanced opinions that would be invisible to single-mode analysis systems.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-analysis-capabilities">Detailed Analysis Capabilities</h2>
<p>The platform provides granular breakdowns of content performance and audience reactions. As shown in our analysis results page, users can explore specific themes, track sentiment over time, and identify the most engaging content types. This helps brands understand not just what is being said, but why certain content resonates with their audience.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/analysis_results.png" alt="Analysis Results" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>The opinion analysis feature goes beyond simple positive/negative sentiment to categorize specific viewpoints and concerns. This allows brands to understand the nuanced perspectives their audience holds, helping them craft more targeted and effective messaging.</p>
<p>

<h2 id="the-mcp-advantage-accessible-functional-calls">The MCP Advantage: Accessible Functional Calls</h2>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/claude_client.png" alt="Claude MCP Entrance" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>We have integrated Model Context Protocols (MCPs) - an emerging standard that simplifies how LLMs interact with specialized tools and data sources. Rather than simple API calls, MCPs provide structured interfaces for LLMs to access specialized capabilities while maintaining context awareness throughout the analysis process.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/claude_mcp_process.png" alt="Claude MCP Process" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>As shown here, when a user submits a research question, the system dynamically determines which analytical capabilities to deploy. The Claude interface serves as the orchestration layer, identifying relevant MCP tools to activate and calling them sequentially:</p>
<ol>
<li>First gathering baseline information through web search</li>
<li>Then performing targeted data collection via specialized TikTok MCP tools</li>
<li>Following with multi-layered analysis of videos and comments</li>
<li>Finally synthesizing everything into coherent, actionable insights</li>
</ol>
<p>This MCP-driven approach creates a dramatic efficiency improvement, reducing complex social media analysis from weeks to minutes while maintaining remarkable analytical depth.</p>
<h2 id="case-study---trump-tariffs">Case Study - Trump Tariffs</h2>
<p>To demonstrate Crowdlistening&rsquo;s capabilities, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of public sentiment regarding Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies. This serves as an excellent test case due to its complexity, polarizing nature, and economic impact.</p>
<p>When a user inputs the query about Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies, our system activates the appropriate MCP tools in sequence. First, it gathers factual background information on the policies themselves, as shown below:</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/trump_background.png" alt="Research Background" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>This background research provides context on what the current tariff policies are, including the 10% baseline tariff on all imports that took effect in April 2025, plus the higher &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs on countries with which the US has trade deficits (34% for China, 20% for the EU, and 24% for Japan).</p>
<p>Next, the system analyzes public opinion on these policies by examining social media content. The analysis reveals highly polarized reactions, categorized into three main perspectives:</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/public_opinion.png" alt="Public Opinion" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>The sentiment analysis dashboard shows that opinions on Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies are distributed as 38% supportive, 42% critical, and 20% neutral or mixed. This visualization helps brands and researchers quickly understand the overall public response landscape.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/trump_sentiment.png" alt="Trump Sentiment" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>One of the most valuable outputs is our projected economic impact analysis. This data visualization clearly presents the concrete financial implications of these policies across multiple domains:</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/economic_impact.png" alt="Economic Impact" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>The analysis shows an estimated $1,300 annual cost increase per US household, a projected 0.8% reduction in long-run US GDP, significant auto price increases ($3,000 for US vehicles, $6,000 for imports), and warnings about market volatility.</p>
<p>Beyond simple pro/con sentiment, our opinion analysis feature categorizes specific viewpoints with remarkable granularity. For instance, when examining comments on related content, we can identify nuanced perspectives and their prevalence:</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/comment_analysis.png" alt="Trump Comments" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<p>This example shows how our system can identify several different comment themes, including positive views of content creators (37.5%), appreciation for intelligent discussion (25%), and concerns about media echo chambers (12.5%). This level of nuanced understanding would be impossible through traditional keyword or basic sentiment analysis.</p>
<h2 id="validation-and-impact">Validation and Impact</h2>
<p>Our solution has been validated through interviews with major brands like L&rsquo;Oreal, confirming we drastically cut the time and cost of social media analysis. Crowdlistening enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid response to emerging trends</li>
<li>Deep understanding of consumer sentiment across demographics</li>
<li>Identification of microtrends before they become mainstream</li>
<li>Competitive intelligence at unprecedented scale</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-future-of-mcp-driven-research">The Future of MCP-Driven Research</h2>
<p>We believe Model Context Protocols represent the future of specialized LLM applications. As shown in our implementation, MCPs provide a structured way for language models to interact with specialized tools and data sources while maintaining context awareness throughout the analysis process.</p>
<p>This approach is likely to become standard in LLM application development given how effectively it bridges the gap between general-purpose AI and domain-specific functionality. We anticipate seeing more MCP clients (interaction surfaces like Claude&rsquo;s interface) emerge as this paradigm gains traction.</p>
<p>For social media analysis specifically, this approach creates a fascinating dynamic where AI-driven insights can actually lead structured reporting in terms of timeliness and depth. By processing and analyzing unstructured social data at scale, we can identify emerging trends and public sentiment shifts before they&rsquo;re covered in traditional reporting.</p>

<p>As noted in &ldquo;Essence of Creativity,&rdquo; the real value in AI-powered tools comes not just from generating content, but from helping users find new perspectives and insights. Our platform serves as both an inspiration acquisition tool (accelerating original content production) and a content understanding tool (helping brands better comprehend their audience). By connecting insight data with generation capabilities, we&rsquo;re creating the kind of breakthrough product that bridges the gap between understanding and action.</p>

      <h2>Iterating at the Pace of AI</h2>
      <p class="project-meta">August 29, 2025</p>
      <div class="modal-content">
        <p>There are two credible paths to building agentic experiences. The first is platform-first: stand up a unified agent framework with the core capabilities—multi-turn conversation, a knowledge base, and memory—and then layer in signifiers and affordances that fit your environment. The second is scenario-first: begin with the thinnest viable surface and add only the features that demonstrably create value beyond what ChatGPT or Copilot already provide, bringing in memory and other &ldquo;platform&rdquo; features only once they have earned their keep. The platform-first approach yields a consistent engineering experience and lets teams reuse prior agent work, but it risks poor agent–scenario fit. The scenario-first approach can feel messier and demands more from product managers, yet it validates real-world use cases faster. I don&rsquo;t claim one approach is universally better—startups and large companies face different constraints—but I do believe there is only one way to prototype: ship quickly, test explicit hypotheses, and iterate without delay.</p>
<p>A clarifying question keeps this cadence honest: what is the minimum version of the product that lets us learn whether the solution can find product–market fit? Counterintuitively, you often do not need a working prototype to answer that. Walking through end-to-end customer scenarios frequently reveals whether a proposed feature fits existing workflows and where it will break. That said, some questions hinge on new engineering—experiences that are hard to reason about in the abstract. In those cases, the objective is not to &ldquo;build the demo,&rdquo; but to surface and test the assumptions that matter. Each design choice should map to the outcome it seeks and to the user challenge it addresses. The simpler the stack, the more learning cycles you can run with less effort, which is the real engine of progress.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/agent_prototyping/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2: Value adds of &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; tools" loading="lazy">
 
Modern AI coding tools make this possible. Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code compress build time by generating boilerplate, suggesting common patterns, and helping troubleshoot. A single engineer can now produce a functional MVP in a fraction of the time that used to require a small team. Much like Figma tightened the collaboration loop in design, these tools narrow the gap between product intent and implementation. The result is not merely faster engineering; it is broader participation. Product managers, designers, even sales and customer success teams can test ideas more directly, while engineers concentrate on production-grade systems and reliability concerns that truly benefit from their specialization.</p>
<h2 id="involving-cross-functional-stakeholders">Involving Cross-Functional Stakeholders</h2>
<p>An agentic experience is only as good as our understanding of the underlying problem. This is especially true for expert workflows—consumption-based cost estimation or SOC investigation, for example—where product and engineering teams are rarely the domain experts. Involving architects, sales engineers, and analysts only at the prompt-iteration stage is not enough. To build agent behaviors that actually fit, we have to internalize existing workflows and best practices, then design signifiers and affordances that match practitioner expectations. Language, steps, intermediate outputs, and handoffs should mirror how experts already think and work. When the agent speaks their dialect and respects their process, adoption follows because the experience feels native rather than novel for novelty&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>

<p>This is exactly where the Figma analogy—Kevin Kwok&rsquo;s point about non-linear returns from tighter collaboration loops—becomes operational. Figma did not just make drawing easier; it made critique, alignment, and decision-making happen in the same place, by the right people, at the right time. AI coding assistants catalyze a similar shift for agentic products: they collapse the distance between a domain expert&rsquo;s intent and a working prototype, making assumptions explicit, turning tacit heuristics into checkable rules, and surfacing disagreements while they are still cheap to resolve. When prototypes function as shared canvases—co-edited by PMs, engineers, and subject-matter experts—the loop tightens further: experts shape the signifiers and workflows, product sharpens the hypotheses, and engineering focuses on robustness and safety. The compounding return comes not from adding more features, but from aligning agent behavior with the realities of the domain.</p>
<h2 id="learnings-from-the-cost-estimator-agent">Learnings from the Cost Estimator Agent</h2>
<p>To ground these principles, let&rsquo;s look at an agentic implementation of a cost estimation scenario</p>
<p>

 </p>
<h3 id="project-context">Project Context</h3>
<p>Customers need accurate cost estimates for budget planning and solution comparison, yet consumption-based pricing is notoriously hard to predict. We heard repeatedly from the field that this uncertainty stalls decisions and, in competitive deals, can tilt outcomes against us. Existing tools do not help enough. Web calculators feel like black boxes with coarse, inflexible inputs and little transparency. Spreadsheet models are opaque and fragile, with assumptions scattered across cells. Both often ask for inputs customers do not understand or cannot provide without heavy translation.</p>
<p>In other words, this is not a known unknowns problem where a general-purpose copilot can retrieve an answer upon request. Nor is it an unknown knowns problem where the customer already has a tried-and-true estimation method and we simply need to automate it. It is often an unknown unknowns problem: customers do not know what to ask, and they do not have the raw data in the needed form. The result is planning paralysis and, ultimately, stalled or lost deals.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/agent_prototyping/figure5.png" alt="Figure 5: The Knowledge Quadrant mapping agent scenarios" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<h3 id="design-rationale">Design Rationale</h3>
<p>Designing for &ldquo;unknown unknowns&rdquo; required optimizing along three intertwined dimensions. First, we focused on transparency and control so that users could see the reasoning behind estimates—the assumptions, intermediate calculations, and trade-offs—and adjust inputs with confidence. Numbers without narrative do not build trust, and trust is the currency of estimation. Second, we embedded domain expertise directly in the experience. Instead of pushing the knowledge gap back to the user, the system translated familiar facts—industry patterns, ingestion profiles, retention policies—into the metrics the pricing model requires, pre-populating where possible and teaching as it went. Third, we treated estimation as a process rather than a form, and we designed for iterative refinement. The goal was not a one-shot answer but a guided conversation that converges on confidence.</p>
<p>At a basic level, we began with an agent side-panel, similar to a Copilot, to unify product documentation, pricing schemas, and frequently asked questions. This supported conversational guidance throughout the estimation process, but it also exposed three frictions we had to solve in order to achieve fit. First, use-case discovery was weak: without strong signifiers, users did not know what to ask and often ventured beyond the agent&rsquo;s scope. Second, chat lacked context: humans are economical with effort, so expecting users to restate all the fields they had filled and the stage they were in created unnecessary friction. Third, people don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know: there is a structural gap between what customers know about their business (for example, number of users, typical event patterns) and what we require to estimate costs (for example, daily gigabytes ingested). Simply asking, &ldquo;How many gigabytes per day?&rdquo; does not bridge that gap.</p>
<p>These insights shaped a prototype with two synchronized surfaces: a pricing panel and an agent panel kept in bidirectional sync. Edits in the graphical interface updated the conversation&rsquo;s context, and the agent&rsquo;s reasoning flowed back as explanation cards anchored beside the fields they affected.</p>
<p>In brownfield scenarios, the agent could pull relevant account signals to prefill inputs and explain each value&rsquo;s provenance. In greenfield scenarios, the experience offered size recommendations—small, medium, large, enterprise—that users could apply with one click, each accompanied by clear rationales and editable assumptions.</p>
<p>When hard numbers were missing—say, daily ingestion in gigabytes—the agent asked questions users could answer about environment size, event rates, and retention needs, then converted those responses into derived estimates, showing the math and inviting adjustments. Under the hood, a focused knowledge base provided product and pricing facts, while three structured workflows—volume estimation, pricing estimation, and design recommendations—gave the conversation shape and kept it oriented toward decisions rather than dialogue for its own sake.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-and-benchmarking">Evaluation and Benchmarking</h2>
<p>Agent platforms encourage generality, but effectiveness must be demonstrated on concrete tasks. We evaluate the experience by asking whether it completes representative estimation scenarios end to end, how its outputs compare to human-expert baselines, and how quickly it converges to a result stakeholders trust. Accuracy matters, but so do user effort and confidence. When building agentic experiences, we should track time to an acceptable estimate, the number of clarifying turns, and whether users report understanding and accepting the assumptions they carry forward. Scenario coverage also matters: behavior needs to hold not only in the &ldquo;happy path,&rdquo; but across brownfield and greenfield cases, high-volume and bursty workloads, and strict-retention and cost-optimized policies. When behavior degrades, it should degrade gracefully with clear explanations, ranges, or a handoff to a human expert.</p>
<p>In larger organizations, evaluation pairs with safeguards. Data validation and drift monitoring ensure that quotes reflect current pricing and product information, with alerts when underlying references change. Guardrails protect embedded expert logic—estimation methods and pricing strategies—against prompt injection and leakage of system instructions, and they constrain access to sensitive APIs. Finally, bad-case handling is a first-class requirement: the system detects ambiguous inputs, surfaces low-confidence steps, and offers conservative defaults or escalation paths rather than silently producing spurious precision. Specifications and engineering plans that omit scenario walkthroughs, benchmarks, and safeguards drift toward imagined use cases and weak agent–scenario fit; those that include them turn agentic ambition into reliable impact.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Choose a build path that fits your context, but always prototype to learn, not to impress. Use AI tools to shorten the distance between ideas and feedback. Bring domain experts into the design of signifiers and workflows so the agent respects reality. Make reasoning visible, embed expertise at the point of need, and shape the experience for iterative refinement. Then prove it with scenario-based evaluation and strong guardrails. This, I believe, is how you truly iterate at the pace of AI.</p>

        <h2 id="why-we-need-more-ways-to-hear-customers">Why We Need More Ways to Hear Customers</h2>
<p>As product teams scale, direct exposure to customers narrows. We drift into a product → market pattern: build for a vocal few, iterate with them, and accumulate complexity that alienates everyone else. With agentic tools and tighter loops, we can flip to market → product: still partner closely with a subset of customers, but also listen more broadly, form grounded hypotheses from authentic needs, then decide what to build.</p>
<p>

 </p>
<h2 id="the-ai-way-to-do-it">The AI Way to Do It</h2>
<p>Traditional social listening tracks competitors and brand chatter. We extend it to enterprise product building. Beyond internal testers and formal channels, the internet already hosts rich, first-party signals about how products—ours and others—land in the wild: community forums, Q&amp;A sites, GitHub issues, Reddit/HN threads, and support communities. If we capture, filter, and reason over that discourse responsibly, we get a truer view of pain points, expectations, and the language users actually use.</p>
<h3 id="practical-workflow">Practical workflow</h3>
<p>1.Targeted discovery (for specific questions): compile a tight corpus from public discussions, extract and normalize text, then reason over it with a large-context LLM to label and synthesize themes.
2.Open-ended exploration (for fuzzy spaces): generate sentence/thread embeddings, cluster semantically, and label themes with short, evidence-linked summaries.</p>
<p>Every theme flows into a decision scaffold—theme → testable hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement—to prevent “insight theater.” Longer-term, run an always-on Customer Insight Radar that ingests external communities plus internal notes (with privacy filters), tracks theme velocity, and attaches representative quotes so PMs and engineers can feel the evidence behind the numbers.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/posts/need_validation/audience_sentiment.png" alt="Figure 2: Audience sentiment concerning Microsoft Sentinel" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<h3 id="primary-vs-secondary-sources">Primary vs. secondary sources</h3>
<p>Treat raw online discourse (posts, threads, issue comments) as primary research and polished content (blogs, vendor write-ups, SEO pages) as secondary. “Deep research” tools often paraphrase what’s indexed. We optimize for original insight, not summaries of summaries: go to the source, weight firsthand accounts more heavily, and use secondary material only for background or triangulation.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-more-on-embeddings-and-why-they-help">A Bit More on Embeddings (and Why They Help)</h2>
<p>Embeddings convert messy text into dense vectors where closeness reflects meaning. Early static methods (skip-gram/CBOW, GloVe) learn one vector per word—fast and useful for clustering, but they blur senses (“bill” the invoice vs. “bill” the law). Contextual encoders produce different vectors for the same word depending on context and can be pooled to sentence/document embeddings.</p>
<p>For social listening, sentence/document embeddings are the workhorse: they enable semantic search (“unreconcilable line items” ↔ “can’t map charges to usage”), organic theme discovery without hand-built taxonomies, and drift tracking as language shifts. In practice, we embed at sentence and thread granularity, use ANN indexing for retrieval, and favor density-based or hierarchical clustering to fit the uneven shape of real discussions—always anchoring themes to verbatim quotes for auditability.</p>
<h2 id="reasoning-models-and-visualizations">Reasoning Models and Visualizations</h2>
<p>With smaller datasets, we can directly provide the extracted raw text to a large-context, strong-reasoning model. This goes beyond coarse sentiment categories or word clouds, enabling richer context and actionable insights. Curated prompts let an LLM (or agent) read the semantic neighborhoods, surface key themes, note counter-signals, and propose testable hypotheses.</p>
<p>

 </p>
<h3 id="what-the-output-isand-isnt">What the output is—and isn&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>The output isn’t a slide; it’s a decision input. Each synthesized theme should map to a testable product hypothesis, an opportunity-size signal, and an instrumentation plan—the same scaffold above that keeps the loop tight.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-it-in-action">Seeing It in Action</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-the-cost-experience">Example 1: The Cost Experience</h3>
<p>From ~700 candidate threads, we curated ~100 high-signal discussions (Reddit, HN, Quora, vendor/community forums), normalized text, embedded at sentence/thread level, clustered themes, and linked each to example quotes. One dominant signal emerged: billing complexity and transparency drive most cost-related UX pain. Users struggle to reconcile invoices to usage, discover overruns after month-end, and use calculators that ignore dynamic workloads—leading to surprise spikes. Strategically, users prefer predictable costs over merely lower costs. The advantage is cost-experience design (real-time transparency, proactive controls, behavior-aware forecasting) rather than discounts alone. Platform “flavors” vary (e.g., BigQuery pricing confusion, Snowflake credit visibility, Databricks cluster trade-offs, Splunk ingestion spikes, Redshift monitoring blind spots), but the design response is consistent: plain-English cost impact at point of action, pre-threshold alerts, safe throttles, and workload-aware forecasting.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-tier-2-soc-analyst-friction">Example 2: Tier-2 SOC Analyst Friction</h3>
<p>Across tools, five universal barriers appear:
1.query language/parsing complexity;
2.false-positive overload;
3.correlation/integration hurdles across silos;
4.workflow friction from context switching and ad-hoc processes;
5.platform limitations that pull analysts into tool troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Design mandate: lower technical barriers, suppress noise, preserve investigative context, and streamline common paths so analysts spend time on threats—not tool mechanics. Agentic experiences and stronger defaults move the needle fastest.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/posts/need_validation/crowdlistening_overview.png" alt="Figure 4: Crowdlistening Overview" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<h2 id="crowdlistening">Crowdlistening</h2>
<p>As shown in the cost-estimation agent presentation, Crowdlistening is a tool I built to extract patterns from collective discourse without flattening individual voices. It pairs LLM reasoning with a larger-context pipeline to ingest public discussions, structure them, and tie findings back to evidence. At its core, Crowdlistening treats raw discourse as primary data, emphasizes traceability (“show your work”), and optimizes for original insight over derivative summaries.</p>
<p>Crowdlistening&rsquo;s goal isn&rsquo;t forced consensus; it&rsquo;s to surface authentic needs, native customer language, and edge cases that formal channels miss. At enterprise scale—where the user base is large and diverse—listening broadly helps us prioritize what&rsquo;s real over what&rsquo;s merely loud. (More background at Crowdlistening.com.)</p>
<p>Since the launch of MCPs, I&rsquo;ve experimented with exposing Crowdlistening capabilities as MCP servers—directly accessible in clients like Copilot or Claude. Features remain similar (with some visualization limits), but inputs become more nuanced and multi-turn, making the experience far more intuitive for non-technical users.</p>
<h2 id="building-this-at-large-organizations">Building This at Large Organizations</h2>
<h3 id="a-feature-proposal">A Feature Proposal</h3>
<p>To enable the market → product workflow (listen broadly → form grounded hypotheses → decide what to build), we can ship a Copilot MCP integration as a conversational guide for early spec writing. It would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingest customer meeting transcripts and selected online discussions,</li>
<li>Run evidence-linked synthesis with clear citations to primary sources,</li>
<li>Produce theme → hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement scaffolds that slot directly into specs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="governance-and-guardrails">Governance and Guardrails</h3>
<p>Social data is messy and sensitive. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply strict sourcing, deduplication, and consent practices; avoid PII capture.</li>
<li>Measure representativeness to reduce sampling bias.</li>
<li>Link every synthesized claim to auditable evidence (&ldquo;show your work&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Use MCP-based connectors so data plumbing remains inspectable and secure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-thought">Closing Thought</h2>
<p>AI-enabled social listening doesn’t replace customer calls, design research, or telemetry; it enriches them—especially at the fuzzy front end. Used well, it helps us choose better problems, write crisper specs, and ship experiences that feel obvious in hindsight.</p>

      <h2>Why People Care What Others Think</h2>
      <p class="project-meta">May 12, 2025</p>
      <div class="modal-content">
        <p>In a world dominated by expert opinions and algorithm-driven content, there&rsquo;s something fundamentally human about wanting to know what others think. Whether we admit it or not, we&rsquo;re drawn to understand the collective mindset.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom in crowds. While large groups may not always converge on absolute truths (in fact, many truthful views begin as contrarian positions), they provide something equally valuable: comfort and context. Being part of a group, understanding its thoughts and values, creates a sense of safety and belonging that&rsquo;s deeply wired into our social nature. Even when we disagree with mainstream opinions, understanding them helps us navigate social landscapes and provides reference points for our own thinking. This isn&rsquo;t mere conformity—it&rsquo;s about contextualizing our experiences within the broader human narrative.</p>
<p>Our information ecosystem has evolved in two problematic directions. On one side, mainstream media delivers curated &ldquo;expert views&rdquo; that often miss nuance. On the other, recommendation algorithms trap us in personalized echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s missing? The authentic, unfiltered perspective of the crowd.</p>
<p>Comment sections, forums, and face-to-face conversations provide windows into what people actually think—unmediated by gatekeepers or algorithms. These spaces, though sometimes chaotic, offer genuine insights that both experts and algorithms frequently miss.</p>
<p>This is where Crowdlistening enters the picture. Rather than filtering out the noise of crowd perspectives, Crowdlistening aims to extract meaningful patterns and insights from collective thought. It&rsquo;s about amplifying voices without homogenizing them. By understanding what people collectively think—their concerns, insights, and experiences—we can build products, services, and communities that truly resonate. The crowd isn&rsquo;t always right, but it&rsquo;s always worth listening to.</p>
<p>When we learn to listen to crowds effectively, we gain access to a type of distributed intelligence that no single expert or algorithm can match. In our increasingly fragmented information landscape, this skill becomes not just valuable but essential.</p>

      <h2>Value Add of AI: Generation as Distribution</h2>
      <p class="project-meta">May 8, 2025</p>
      <div class="modal-content">
        <h2 id="the-evolution-of-ai-value">The Evolution of AI Value</h2>
<p>The first wave of generative AI focused primarily on content creation - ChatGPT writing articles, Midjourney generating images, essentially replacing traditional production roles. However, as these technologies mature, their greatest value might well shift towards distribution and personalization rather than raw production.</p>
<h2 id="from-rss-to-recommender-systems">From RSS to Recommender Systems</h2>
<p>The evolution of content distribution reveals how technology repeatedly transforms information access. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) represented an early attempt to solve content discovery, providing a pull-based system where users subscribed to feeds they cared about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Personal Note: I interned at China Impact Investing Network (CINN), down the road from Huangzhuang, earning 100 RMB daily for translation and RSS-related tasks - work that would now be largely automated by GPT.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As content volume exploded, the focus shifted to algorithmic distribution through recommender systems. These attempted to match existing content to user preferences through increasingly sophisticated methods, but still fundamentally operated on a &ldquo;create once, distribute many times&rdquo; model.</p>
<h2 id="content-creation-vs-distribution-costs">Content Creation vs. Distribution Costs</h2>
<p>The economics of content have always been defined by the balance between creation and distribution costs, as illustrated in our visualization. Traditional models rely on two fundamentally different approaches:</p>
<h3 id="professional-vs-user-generated-content-economics">Professional vs. User-Generated Content Economics</h3>
<p>Traditional PGC platforms invest heavily in upfront content creation ($200-500 per article) while optimizing distribution costs ($0.001 per user). This creates an economic model where high-quality, centrally produced content must reach massive scale to be sustainable. Users remain passive consumers with minimal influence on content direction.</p>
<p>UGC platforms invert this model by outsourcing creation costs to users while investing primarily in discovery infrastructure. This creates greater diversity but inconsistent quality. Both approaches increasingly allocate resources to distribution rather than creation as competition for attention intensifies.</p>
<p>The discovery paradox emerges: as content volume increases, the marginal value of new content approaches zero without effective discovery mechanisms. Users face decision fatigue from too many choices, and the market naturally shifts investment toward discovery rather than production.</p>
<h2 id="generation-as-distribution-personalized-content-at-scale">Generation as Distribution: Personalized Content at Scale</h2>
<p>AI fundamentally changes this paradigm by collapsing the distinction between production and distribution. When content can be generated at the moment of consumption, personalized for each user, the model shifts from:</p>
<p>Traditional: Create once → Distribute to millions<br>
Generative: Create parameters → Generate millions of variations</p>
<p>The dual-axis economics chart reveals this transformation. Traditional content scales efficiently after high initial investment but delivers mediocre value. Generative approaches provide dramatically higher user value but face linearly increasing costs that become prohibitive at scale.</p>
<p>The optimal approach emerges through content modularity - recognizing that not everything needs regeneration. By identifying which components provide the most personalization value, hybrid approaches can maintain 80% of personalization benefits at 30% of the cost.</p>
<h2 id="the-602020-rule-strategic-content-modularity">The 60/20/20 Rule: Strategic Content Modularity</h2>
<p>Most knowledge domains contain substantial core material that remains consistent across users. The 60/20/20 rule maximizes efficiency by segmenting content into:</p>
<ul>
<li>60% static core content (foundational principles, established facts)</li>
<li>20% cohort-level content (industry examples, cultural contexts)</li>
<li>20% individual personalization (connections to personal experience, learning pace)</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach creates a fundamentally different economic curve that scales more efficiently than traditional content while maintaining most personalization benefits. For a business book distributed to 50,000 professionals, this approach can deliver twice the relevance at the same cost as traditional publishing.</p>
<h2 id="multi-modal-personalization-beyond-text">Multi-modal Personalization: Beyond Text</h2>
<p>The personalization paradigm extends beyond text to encompass multiple modalities. Content can dynamically transform between formats - text summaries becoming virtual presenter videos, complex topics converting to interactive explanations, news transforming into personalized audio briefings. This multi-modal capability increases generation costs but dramatically enhances engagement and information retention.</p>
<p>These cross-modal transformations add approximately 30-40% to generation costs but can increase engagement by 200-300%, creating compelling economics despite the higher production expense. Each user&rsquo;s preferred learning style becomes another dimension for personalization.</p>
<h2 id="the-user-advocate-beyond-algorithmic-recommendation">The User Advocate: Beyond Algorithmic Recommendation</h2>
<p>The most powerful personalization emerges not from content formatting but from deeper user understanding. The User Advocate concept represents an AI persona that truly comprehends the user&rsquo;s interests, knowledge level, and perspective, then guides content creation accordingly.</p>
<p>Unlike recommendation systems that rely on sparse signals, the Advocate builds a comprehensive user model through conversation and observation. This enables exploration of &ldquo;unknown unknowns&rdquo; - valuable topics users didn&rsquo;t know to search for. The approach fundamentally changes platform economics by aligning incentives with actual user satisfaction rather than engagement metrics.</p>
<h2 id="fluid-knowledge-and-the-future">Fluid Knowledge and the Future</h2>
<p>The most significant impact of AI lies not in replacing content creators but in transforming how knowledge flows to individuals. As the internet solved information scarcity, generative AI now solves the problem of relevance through &ldquo;fluid knowledge&rdquo; (知识液化) that adapts perfectly to each person&rsquo;s context.</p>
<p>In this emerging paradigm, content becomes transformable across formats, users experience the feeling of being truly understood, and exploration replaces search as the primary discovery model. The User Advocate becomes a critical interface between vast information spaces and human understanding, fundamentally changing our relationship with knowledge acquisition.</p>

<p>Video URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOYSDqJdiro">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOYSDqJdiro</a></p>
<p>Usable AI agents are finally here from deep research platforms out of OpenAI and Google to similar tools from XAI and DeepSeek. Joining the competition now is Manus, a brand new agentic AI platform that has taken the world by storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today we&rsquo;re launching an early preview of Manus, the first general AI agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Manus officially launched, the hype around it immediately took off. A Chinese startup unveiling a new AI agent that some are calling &ldquo;China&rsquo;s next DeepSeek moment,&rdquo; with people calling it &ldquo;the most impressive AI tool they&rsquo;ve ever tried&rdquo; and &ldquo;the most sophisticated computer-using AI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike some of its predecessors, Manus wasn&rsquo;t just another specialized chatbot. It promised to be a true general-purpose AI agent. With invitations rare and access limited, the question remains: has Manus truly revolutionized the AI agent landscape?</p>
<h2 id="how-manus-works">How Manus Works</h2>
<p>Behind all the excitement around Manus is something genuinely innovative: a multi-agent AI system that can seemingly complete all sorts of tasks from travel planning and financial analysis to searching over dozens of files or doing industry research.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on one big neural network, Manus works more like an executive overseeing a team of sub-agents, coordinating and guiding their every move across a shared action space. It takes in your prompt as input and gets to work figuring out what it needs to do.</p>
<p>Instead of tackling your task in one go, Manus employs a sophisticated approach. A planner agent first comes up with a master plan to follow, breaking things down into manageable subtasks. This way Manus knows precisely what needs to be done before executing and can hand off these tasks to other sub-agents. These sub-agents are like Manus&rsquo;s own in-house experts - they share the same context but each has its own delineated domain from knowledge or memory to execution.</p>
<p>Manus can call upon an extensive suite of 29 different integrated tools, whether they&rsquo;re automating web navigation, securely running code, or pulling important information from files. Manus&rsquo; sub-agents intelligently decide which tools to use.</p>
<p>Finally, when each subtask is complete, the executor agent combines the outputs together into a final synthesized output for the user.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>Under the hood, Manus is powered by a sophisticated dynamic task decomposition algorithm. This is what enables it to autonomously break down complex instructions into clear execution paths.</p>
<p>To ensure stability even after dozens of rounds of reasoning and tool use, the Manus team developed an original technique called &ldquo;chain of thought injection,&rdquo; enabling agents to actively reflect and update plans.</p>
<p>At its core, Manus makes use of Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Manus also features robust cross-platform execution capabilities thanks to its seamless integration with open-source tools like YC company Browser.js for advanced website interaction and startup E2B&rsquo;s secure cloud sandbox environment.</p>
<h2 id="capabilities-and-performance">Capabilities and Performance</h2>
<p>What can Manus actually accomplish? Impressively, it can take on a wide range of real-world tasks. These include creating travel itineraries, performing detailed financial analyses, developing educational content, compiling structured databases, comparing insurance policies, sourcing suppliers, and assisting with high-quality presentations.</p>
<p>To truly measure Manus&rsquo; capabilities, we can look at Gaia, a benchmark designed to challenge AI agents on reasoning, multimodal handling, web browsing, and tool proficiency. Humans typically score about 92% on this benchmark, while OpenAI&rsquo;s Deep Research scored about 74% at its best. Manus smashed the state-of-the-art on Gaia, scoring 86.5%, just a few points shy of the average human.</p>
<h2 id="the-wrapper-debate">The &ldquo;Wrapper&rdquo; Debate</h2>
<p>Despite impressive benchmark performance, Manus has reignited a broader conversation about the nature of AI startups at the application layer: &ldquo;wrappers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some have dismissed Manus as merely a wrapper, since it stitches together existing foundational models and various tool calls. But this dismissal overlooks an important reality: most successful AI products today could also qualify as wrappers by this logic.</p>
<p>Cursor and Warp, for example, integrate existing LLMs alongside external APIs and developer-focused tooling such as real-time code analysis and debugging utilities. Domain-specific agents like Harvey combine foundational models with legal-specific tool integrations, case law retrieval, compliance checks, and document analysis.</p>
<p>Clearly, many useful applications do fit the wrapper mold, and for many developers, it makes sense to go this route. As Manus co-founder Yizhow Peak G told us himself, &ldquo;From day one they decided to work orthogonally to model development, wanting to be excited rather than threatened by each new model release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What distinguishes successful wrappers from their less effective counterparts is typically a bunch of things: intuitive UI, proprietary evals, much more careful fine-tuning of foundational models, and thoughtfully designed multi-agent architectures.</p>
<h2 id="strengths-and-limitations">Strengths and Limitations</h2>
<p>Manus itself illustrates these trade-offs really well:</p>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths:</h3>
<p>Its multi-agent orchestration helps deliver significantly lower per-task costs (around $2 a task compared to integrated competitors like OpenAI&rsquo;s Deep Research). It offers greater transparency and user control, letting users directly inspect, customize, or replace individual sub-agents and tool integrations. Additionally, it provides a degree of flexibility centralized platforms rarely match.</p>
<p>One of the coolest things Manus figured out was actually exposing the file system so you could see exactly what the agents were doing. Chat GPT requires you to reprompt, and it&rsquo;s opaque what&rsquo;s happening when it&rsquo;s thinking. Manus is a glimpse into the future of Chat GPT desktop operating directly on your computer, and it will be cool to see how much more control you&rsquo;ll get when it&rsquo;s happening there instead of a browser.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations:</h3>
<p>Coordination across specialized agents becomes increasingly difficult as tasks scale or complexity grows. Its current advantages (UX refinements, targeted fine-tuning, thoughtful integrations) are vulnerable to competitors just coming along and doing that as well.</p>
<p>These strengths and weaknesses are generally shared by wrappers. They allow rapid deployment, iteration, and specialized UX at lower upfront cost. However, they&rsquo;re vulnerable to disruption such as API pricing changes or provider policy shifts, which can quickly erase any cost benefits.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-ai-products">The Future of AI Products</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the critical challenge isn&rsquo;t deciding whether wrappers are viable but identifying genuinely sustainable differentiation for your product.</p>
<p>For founders, this might mean investing early in proprietary evals that are expensive or time-consuming to replicate, embedding workflows deeply into specific user routines to increase switching costs, and identifying integrations with platforms or data sets competitors can&rsquo;t easily access.</p>
<p>In the end, success in AI doesn&rsquo;t hinge on reinventing the wheel but rather on who can stitch together the existing models into a product users genuinely love.</p>

        <p>When you want to look for user pain points, go to a bar in the middle of the week, look for the most desparate looking person and buy them a beer. They&rsquo;d probably have something substantial to talk about. While I don&rsquo;t usually go to bars during weekdays, I&rsquo;ve found some similar ways of identifying user needs, mostly through conversations or online forums. This is a running document of the user needs or pain points that I&rsquo;ve found to be interesting. Perhaps some of them will turn out to be viable business oppportunities.</p>
<h2 id="more-apparent-ones">More apparent ones:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Career seeking: it&rsquo;s a difficult job market, whether it&rsquo;s doing leetcode or preparing for behavioral interviews, people want a way to cheat their way out of this difficult process, and they&rsquo;re willing to pay for it too.</li>
</ul>
<p>2025-03-27</p>

<li>
<p>Agentic worklows: I&rsquo;m usually more skeptical towards areas more widely reported, but agentic workflows may well be here to stay. From the initial action gpts (autogpt) agent chains (devin, metagpt, cogno etc), to the more recent operators (MCPs, OpenAI operator), it would indeed be nice to have agents act on our behalf (perhaps hopefuly not the way Anton goes about ordering Hamburgers in Silcon Valley).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building on the previous point concerning agentic computer use. It&rsquo;s also interesting to consider the two approaches towards web navigation: vision-based and ai-native-ui. While people like Aravind Srinivas have openly expressed their skepicism towards vision based web operations, noting the limitations imposed by operating systems, especially iOS, which restrict access to other applications, vision-based web interactions are inherently more versatile and flexible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content generation: Generative ai is at its core, generative. We have for the past three years seen numerous improvements in text/image/video/avatar generation, with applications in vairous forms of UGC (and now nearing PGC) ads, podcasts, short-form videos. I love how creative people have been with the available AI tools, but at the same time, I view these tools as an available means to scale creativity, not for enabling 0-1 creation.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Note that <a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a> is a paid service. This raises an interesting point about the future of AI generated content and suggestions. On one hand, the result is based on training data inputted into the model, but at the same time, one can easily manipulate it to recommend one solution over another (try Formspree vs Google Forms). This presents an interesting avenue for ads via llm generated content, and given the extent to which people are willing to trust llm results, this could even be an effective avenue. Yet in doing so, we are also risking the reliability of llm generated content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEO is already changing in the age of LLMs, with AI genearated content flooding web browsers. Another interesting observation is the amount of website traffic going to specific companies from AI-enabled search services such as Perplexity. While looking at website traffic for <a href="https://www.genspark.ai/">Genspark</a> and a few other websites, we can see both ChatGPT and Perplexity listed as the top referring websites (source: similarweb) Though the accuracy of this data is yet to be determined, it make sense intuitively that, owing to the large amount of content genearted via these AI platforms, the pages will be easily indexed by ai-browsers.</p>

<li>Better customization: Traditionally, a tradeoff existed between customization and scale. Creating for wider audiences required standardized offerings. However, as LLM inference costs rapidly decrease, information retrieval and content generation are approaching fixed costs. This shift enables customization at scale across various domains—personalized news, cinematography, and other content formats. Additionally, advancements in multimodal capabilities (voice, image, video) will likely introduce greater variety in the content we consume.</li>

        <h1 id="exploring-unknown-unknowns-the-future-of-knowledge-interfaces">Exploring Unknown Unknowns: The Future of Knowledge Interfaces</h1>
<p>We live in an age of information abundance, yet many of us struggle with two fundamental learning challenges: we don&rsquo;t know what to read, and we don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;ve read. These pain points—&ldquo;not knowing how to choose&rdquo; and &ldquo;not knowing how to comprehend&rdquo;—represent a massive opportunity for reimagining how we interact with knowledge.</p>
<p>The core insight driving next-generation learning interfaces is simple but profound: most people don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know. We can&rsquo;t formulate good questions about topics we&rsquo;re unfamiliar with, yet traditional learning systems expect us to do exactly that. This creates a barrier that conversational AI can uniquely solve by flipping the interaction model entirely.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-search-learning-from-googles-experiments">Beyond Search: Learning from Google&rsquo;s Experiments</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Learn About product offers a compelling glimpse of this future. Unlike traditional search, which requires users to know what to look for, Learn About allows users to &ldquo;zoom out and look at the space of questions around your question.&rdquo; It combines the information accuracy of search with the flexible, dynamic interaction of AI chat, creating an exploratory learning experience that goes far beyond simple Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>This approach represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to knowledge discovery. Instead of returning static results, the system actively helps users explore adjacent concepts and ask better questions. Users can pursue their immediate curiosity while simultaneously discovering related topics they never thought to investigate.</p>
<p>The most innovative learning interfaces take this concept further by specializing in specific domains. Rather than trying to handle all possible queries, they focus on particular knowledge areas—like literature, technical documentation, or professional development—where they can provide genuinely superior experiences compared to general-purpose tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-llm-architecture-behind-intelligent-learning">The LLM Architecture Behind Intelligent Learning</h2>
<p>The technical foundation of these systems relies on sophisticated prompt engineering and modular content generation. Large language models serve as the cognitive engine, but their raw output must be carefully structured to create coherent learning experiences. The key innovation lies in using LLMs to generate JSON-formatted responses that populate predefined UI templates, creating consistent yet dynamic interfaces.</p>
<p>This architecture allows the system to maintain conversational flow while presenting information in learner-friendly formats. For example, instead of generating wall-of-text responses, the LLM outputs structured data that renders as interactive cards, related questions, and exploration pathways. Each response includes not just content, but also suggested next steps and connection points to related topics.</p>
<p>The prompt engineering becomes crucial here. Effective systems use detailed behavioral instructions that guide the LLM to act as a knowledgeable teacher rather than a simple question-answering service. These prompts specify tone, content depth, interaction style, and response structure, ensuring consistency across thousands of potential learning conversations.</p>
<h2 id="reducing-cognitive-friction-through-design">Reducing Cognitive Friction Through Design</h2>
<p>Traditional learning interfaces suffer from what could be called &ldquo;prompt friction&rdquo;—the cognitive overhead of formulating good questions and organizing complex thoughts into text. The most successful knowledge interfaces minimize this friction through several design strategies.</p>
<p>First, they embed potential questions directly into content responses. Instead of requiring users to think of follow-up questions, the system generates three or four relevant next steps that users can explore with a simple click. This transforms learning from an active questioning process into a guided exploration where curiosity can flow naturally.</p>
<p>Second, they use modular response formats that pack high knowledge density into digestible chunks. Rather than lengthy explanations, responses combine concise answers with interactive elements: reflection prompts, knowledge checks, relevance connections, and vocabulary builders. Users receive exactly the information they need while being invited to go deeper on specific aspects that interest them.</p>
<p>Third, they implement &ldquo;prompt prefills&rdquo;—pre-written questions and conversation starters that help users begin productive dialogues without staring at blank input fields. These aren&rsquo;t generic suggestions but contextually relevant questions based on the current topic and common learning patterns.</p>
<h2 id="personalization-through-conversational-intelligence">Personalization Through Conversational Intelligence</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on explicit preferences or behavioral tracking, conversational learning interfaces build user understanding organically through dialogue. Each interaction reveals information about the user&rsquo;s background knowledge, interests, learning goals, and preferred depth of explanation.</p>
<p>This conversational profiling enables increasingly sophisticated personalization. The system learns whether a user prefers concrete examples or abstract concepts, detailed explanations or high-level overviews, historical context or contemporary applications. Over time, responses become naturally calibrated to individual learning styles and knowledge levels.</p>
<p>The personalization extends beyond content delivery to include book recommendations, topic suggestions, and learning path optimization. By understanding what concepts a user struggles with and what types of explanations resonate, the system can proactively surface relevant material and adapt its teaching approach in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="technical-implementation-rag-and-knowledge-curation">Technical Implementation: RAG and Knowledge Curation</h2>
<p>Behind the conversational interface lies a sophisticated knowledge management system. Rather than relying solely on LLM training data, effective learning platforms implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures that combine real-time information retrieval with language generation.</p>
<p>This approach proves particularly valuable for specialized domains like literature analysis, where high-quality, curated knowledge sources significantly improve response accuracy and depth. Systems can draw from structured databases of book analyses, expert commentary, reader discussions, and academic sources to provide richer, more authoritative answers than general-purpose models alone.</p>
<p>The challenge lies in balancing different information sources. Community discussions from platforms like Reddit offer authentic reader perspectives and common questions, while academic sources provide authoritative analysis. Professional reviews and curated summaries add editorial quality. Effective systems learn to synthesize these different knowledge types based on the specific question and user context.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-success-beyond-engagement">Measuring Success Beyond Engagement</h2>
<p>Traditional educational metrics often miss the point of exploratory learning. While engagement metrics like session length and click-through rates provide some insight, the real value lies in knowledge acquisition and curiosity development. The most meaningful measures focus on learning outcomes: Do users ask better questions over time? Do they make novel connections between concepts? Do they pursue deeper investigation of topics that initially seemed uninteresting?</p>
<p>Advanced systems track conversation quality through several indicators: the progression from basic to sophisticated questions, the frequency of cross-topic connections, the depth of follow-up exploration, and user-generated insights that suggest genuine understanding. These metrics help optimize not just for engagement, but for actual learning effectiveness.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-knowledge-work">The Future of Knowledge Work</h2>
<p>As these interfaces mature, they point toward a fundamental transformation in how we approach knowledge work. Instead of consuming information passively, we&rsquo;ll increasingly collaborate with AI systems to explore ideas, test understanding, and discover unexpected connections. The goal isn&rsquo;t to replace human thinking but to augment it with better tools for curiosity and exploration.</p>
<p>The most promising applications extend beyond individual learning to collaborative knowledge building. Imagine research environments where teams can explore complex topics together, with AI facilitators helping surface relevant connections, identify knowledge gaps, and guide productive discussions. Or educational settings where students learn not just facts but how to ask increasingly sophisticated questions about any domain.</p>
<p>The technical foundation already exists. The remaining challenge is design: creating interfaces that feel natural, educational experiences that genuinely improve understanding, and systems that scale personalized learning without losing the human touch that makes great teaching transformative.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The next time you encounter a complex topic, imagine having a knowledgeable guide who not only answers your questions but helps you discover the questions you didn&rsquo;t know to ask. That&rsquo;s the promise of intelligent knowledge interfaces—and it&rsquo;s closer than you might think.</em></p>

      <h2>Why Context is Everything in AI Content Generation</h2>
      <p class="project-meta">September 20, 2024</p>
      <div class="modal-content">
        <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we&rsquo;re witnessing a fundamental shift in how we consume and interact with knowledge. While early AI applications focused primarily on content summarization and modal conversion, the next generation of AI-native products promises something far more transformative: the ability to create truly personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual needs, interests, and cognitive patterns.</p>
<p>When we expect AI to output precise, high-quality content based on a single prompt, we&rsquo;re making a fundamental mistake. For AI content to be truly valuable, we must provide sufficient context for it to reason over. The quality of AI output is directly proportional to the richness of context we provide—not just about the topic itself, but about the audience, purpose, constraints, and desired outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="the-limitations-of-current-approaches">The Limitations of Current Approaches</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s AI content tools largely excel at taking existing information and reformatting it into different modalities. We can convert text to audio, create video summaries, or generate podcast-style conversations from written material. However, as Large Language Model context windows continue to expand, simple content summarization becomes increasingly commoditized. The real value lies not in these mechanical transformations, but in the creative synthesis and novel perspectives that emerge when AI systems understand both the content and the consumer.</p>
<p>The essence of creativity lies in finding fresh angles of approach. Quality content distinguishes itself through novel perspectives, clear structure, and genuine utility to the reader. As we move beyond basic summarization, the challenge becomes how to help AI systems discover these unique entry points that make content both engaging and personally relevant.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-liquefaction-the-new-content-paradigm">Knowledge Liquefaction: The New Content Paradigm</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re entering an era of &ldquo;knowledge liquefaction&rdquo; where any piece of information can be rapidly transformed into formats that match specific consumption scenarios. Whether someone needs structured learning materials for deep study or fragmentary content for casual listening during commutes, AI systems can now adapt the same core knowledge to fit these different contexts seamlessly.</p>
<p>This capability extends far beyond simple format conversion. The most compelling applications combine high-quality human-created content with AI&rsquo;s ability to find unexpected connections and generate personalized frameworks. Rather than replacing human creativity, these systems amplify it by identifying patterns and relationships that might not be immediately obvious, then presenting them through personalized lenses that resonate with individual users.</p>
<h2 id="the-personalization-challenge">The Personalization Challenge</h2>
<p>Creating truly personalized content presents a fundamental tension between scale and customization. If every piece of content requires individual adaptation for each user, the costs become prohibitive. However, knowledge fusion offers a solution through its inherent modularity. Many elements of content remain constant across audiences—core concepts, fundamental principles, and essential facts—while the variable elements involve how these concepts connect to individual interests, goals, and existing knowledge.</p>
<p>The key insight is that personalization doesn&rsquo;t require generating entirely new content for each user. Instead, it involves intelligent selection and combination of existing content elements, supplemented by targeted customization that creates meaningful connections to the user&rsquo;s specific context and needs.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-user-understanding-through-interaction">Dynamic User Understanding Through Interaction</h2>
<p>Modern AI systems have unprecedented access to rich user interaction data through natural language conversations, reading highlights, and behavioral patterns. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely primarily on click-through data, AI-native platforms can analyze the semantic content of user queries, the topics they explore, and the questions they ask to build sophisticated models of their interests and learning preferences.</p>
<p>This approach moves beyond simple topic matching to understand cognitive patterns and learning styles. For example, the system might recognize that one user prefers concrete examples and case studies, while another gravitates toward theoretical frameworks and abstract principles. These insights enable the generation of content that not only covers relevant topics but presents them in ways that align with how each individual processes and retains information.</p>
<h2 id="building-memory-systems-that-learn-and-adapt">Building Memory Systems That Learn and Adapt</h2>
<p>The most sophisticated AI-native learning platforms implement memory architectures inspired by human cognition, incorporating episodic memory for recent interactions, semantic memory for abstracted patterns, and procedural memory for learned preferences and behaviors. This multi-layered approach enables systems to maintain context over time while continuously refining their understanding of user needs.</p>
<p>Rather than treating each interaction as isolated, these systems build cumulative knowledge about user interests, expertise levels, and learning goals. They can recognize when someone is exploring a new domain versus deepening existing knowledge, and adjust their content generation accordingly. This longitudinal understanding becomes increasingly valuable as it enables the system to suggest unexpected but relevant connections between seemingly disparate areas of interest.</p>
<h2 id="the-promise-of-adaptive-content-creation">The Promise of Adaptive Content Creation</h2>
<p>The ultimate vision extends beyond personalized recommendation to adaptive content creation. Imagine a system that can take a classic work like Sun Tzu&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of War&rdquo; and generate multiple interpretations tailored to different audiences and applications. For a business professional, it might emphasize strategic planning and competitive analysis. For a parent, it could explore family dynamics and conflict resolution. For a student, it might focus on historical context and philosophical implications.</p>
<p>Each version would maintain the core insights of the original work while presenting them through frameworks and examples that resonate with the specific audience. This approach recognizes that great ideas have universal applicability, but their accessibility depends heavily on how they&rsquo;re presented and contextualized.</p>
<h2 id="technical-implementation-and-practical-considerations">Technical Implementation and Practical Considerations</h2>
<p>Building these capabilities requires sophisticated orchestration of multiple AI systems working in concert. Content generation engines must work alongside user modeling systems, recommendation algorithms, and quality control mechanisms. The challenge lies not just in generating personalized content, but in ensuring it maintains accuracy, coherence, and genuine value while adapting to individual preferences.</p>
<p>Recent advances in multimodal AI and agent-based architectures provide the technical foundation for these applications. Tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers enable modular, composable AI capabilities that can be combined and recombined to address specific user needs. This architectural approach allows for the kind of flexible, adaptive content generation that personalized learning requires.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>As we look toward the future of AI-native learning platforms, the focus shifts from simple automation of existing processes to the creation of entirely new forms of educational experience. The most successful applications will be those that understand the deep relationship between content, context, and individual cognition, using this understanding to create learning experiences that are not just personalized, but genuinely transformative.</p>
<p>The transition from traditional content consumption to AI-enhanced learning represents more than a technological upgrade. It&rsquo;s a fundamental reimagining of how knowledge can be packaged, presented, and absorbed in ways that honor both the richness of human understanding and the unique cognitive patterns of individual learners. In this future, every question becomes an opportunity for personalized exploration, and every piece of content becomes a starting point for deeper, more meaningful engagement with ideas.</p>

      <h2>Essence of Creativity: Future of Creative Work</h2>
      <p class="project-meta">August 25, 2024</p>
      <div class="modal-content">
        <p>This week, I wanted to organize my thoughts about AI-generated content (AIGC) and creativity-related products from the past few months. Rather than focusing solely on my own projects, I&rsquo;d like to explore the foundational aspects of AI product design, interspersing examples from my recent work. First, I want to emphasize that technology is merely a tool intended to better serve business needs. If it doesn&rsquo;t significantly improve efficiency, traditional methods may be more appropriate. Second, despite the many imaginative possibilities of current technology, applications should ultimately be guided by user needs. Finally, AI technologies and markets evolve rapidly, making predictions difficult to validate, but exploring content understanding and generation remains an intriguing challenge.</p>
<h2 id="what-constitutes-creative-work">What Constitutes Creative Work?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss what kind of creativity AI can enable, establishing the capability boundaries of AI applications. Is it creative to &ldquo;take screenshots of someone else&rsquo;s video and caption them with other people&rsquo;s comments on your own account&rdquo;? Though this involves some editing rather than direct reposting, it&rsquo;s difficult to call this creative work. Simple copying only accelerates content diffusion within an ecosystem while reducing the excess returns of original creation, as economist Schumpeter noted.</p>
<p>I believe creativity is more about choosing a unique perspective. Content with contrast or conflict naturally captures our attention, but thoughtful, empathetic content is equally creative. From an ecosystem perspective, creativity can be divided into production and diffusion – the former generating new content, the latter deriving from or spreading existing content.</p>
<p>As for AI&rsquo;s value in this process, generative AI as a probabilistic model struggles to produce content with fresh perspectives. However, it can help us efficiently understand massive amounts of information and generate insights (perspectives). As multimodal AI capabilities (text, image, video) improve, content reproduction costs will rapidly decrease, making products that help users find new inspiration increasingly valuable. Through such creative assistance, we can achieve two main effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inspiration acquisition: Accelerating original content production</li>
<li>Content derivation: Accelerating the diffusion of quality creative work</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="content-understanding-for-enhanced-generation">Content Understanding for Enhanced Generation</h2>
<p>How can we make language models produce outputs that meet our expectations? This challenging question can be further divided into: (1) we don&rsquo;t know what our ideal output looks like, and (2) we know what we want, but the language model doesn&rsquo;t understand us. Most people are trying to solve the latter problem (through model alignment, prompting, few-shot learning, RAG, fine-tuning, memory and caching methods). However, the approaches in this space are increasingly similar, with many solutions being open-sourced, which is why many generative products deliver roughly comparable results. The real differentiation lies in how to adapt engineering and data processing to specific business scenarios.</p>
<p>Returning to the first problem - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what output I want&rdquo; - this stems more from a lack of content understanding. Good script writing requires more than just hooks, USPs, and CTAs; it needs a clear angle: content that resonates with the audience, is appropriate for the context, and achieves its purpose. Some products are creating brand kits or audience profiles to guide more specific content generation through manually defined style rules or user personas. While these types of configurations will likely become common, finding ways to connect insight data with generation without manual setup could be a breakthrough.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-user-needs">Understanding User Needs</h2>
<p>Looking at the creative ecosystem, each creative area (ad aggregation, competitor tracking, brand insights, performance analysis, content generation) has 3-4 companies with minimal data or interaction differences. Data products tend to be traditional, while AI products often rely on simple language model adjustments. A potential differentiator would be acquiring more granular data and creating smoother interactions. Connecting upstream and downstream tasks (complete creative production process with participation/adjustment at each stage) could be an ideal product form.</p>
<p>If we calculate product value as &ldquo;user value = new experience - old experience - replacement cost,&rdquo; we find that most products built on foundational language models (old experience) with fine-tuning or prompting adjustments (incremental new experience) deliver very limited incremental value. From an interaction perspective, users still need to input personalized prompts, and outputs almost always require multiple rounds of editing before use. The question becomes: how do we increase incremental value?</p>
<h2 id="user-friendly-workflows">User-Friendly Workflows</h2>
<p>Currently, creators mostly call upon individual capabilities or data, but single capabilities are insufficient for full-process script/video generation. Building workflows can help users connect various AI capabilities, reducing friction between tool switches.</p>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;workflows, not skills&rdquo; addresses user needs: many users currently need 5-10 AI capabilities to complete their creative work, with most capabilities being disconnected and requiring frequent switching. By establishing a clear workflow, users can more efficiently call upon relevant tools to complete their creative work.</p>
<p>I previously had a misconception that simply connecting capabilities constitutes a workflow, but deeper design is needed. What we consider Language UI is actually Prompt UI, which differs from true language interaction by missing the context and shared understanding present in human-to-human communication. Introducing these elements through features like detailed follow-up questions and future cross-container reference relationships could enhance user experience. Current prompting is likely a transitional form; eventually, we should eliminate the need for context-specific prompts by enabling LLMs to understand context and generate appropriate guidance.</p>
<h2 id="multimodal-interaction-and-content-ecosystem">Multimodal Interaction and Content Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s discuss modality. Given the characteristics of different modalities (text - easily editable, images - non-linear, video - linear), different scenarios should use different modalities. The same user may need different interactions in different contexts.</p>
<p>Switching between modal forms (long/short/mixed) and modal types (text/image/audio/video) will become easier, essentially providing the same content with applicability across different scenarios. Users aren&rsquo;t just people; they&rsquo;re collections of needs. For instance, I might read text at the office due to setting constraints, watch videos while waiting in line with nothing to do, and listen to audio while driving or commuting. The same content may need three modalities (text/video/audio) connected based on the scenario. This could be further refined - people accelerate reading or listening for higher information intake. Finding ways to adapt the same content to different scenarios without increasing creation costs is another interesting challenge.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-voice-synthesis">Case Study: Voice Synthesis</h2>
<p>Take voice synthesis as an example. From a technical perspective, this technology is already quite mature, yet the first application that comes to mind might be phone scams. Other applications include David Attenborough&rsquo;s wildlife narration in open-source projects or OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4o launch event simulating Samantha&rsquo;s voice (originally Scarlett Johansson) from the movie &ldquo;Her.&rdquo; However, I believe short video creators are truly making the best use of this technology.</p>
<p>I recently saw a high-quality derivative work based on &ldquo;In the Name of the People&rdquo; (a 2017 Chinese TV drama). The creator (called &ldquo;Yi Tou Jue Lv&rdquo;) made remarkably deep portrayals of character psychology and inner monologues. Only after reading the comments did I learn that the creator used voice synthesis combined with their understanding of the characters to create this derivative work. Looking through this creator&rsquo;s content, I found they cleverly used the original footage but replaced the narration with autobiographical scripts using AI-synthesized voices, making their work deeper and satisfying more viewer perspectives than their peers – essentially creating a new creative genre.</p>
<h2 id="contrasting-audio--text">Contrasting Audio &amp; Text</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating how differently our brains process audio and text. When we read, we&rsquo;re essentially interacting with a graphical user interface - scanning, jumping between sections, processing information at our own pace. We&rsquo;ve evolved sophisticated tools for text: highlighting, bookmarking, section headers, and search functions. Yet despite these advantages, text may at times feel less engaging than a good conversation. Speaking, in contrast, is inherently linear and social. There&rsquo;s something about the human voice that keeps us present - the subtle shifts in tone, the natural pauses, the back-and-forth rhythm. It&rsquo;s why we can stay engaged in a podcast while walking (and multitask), yet reading typically demands our full attention.</p>
<p>This contrast reveals something deeper about how we process information. Text excels at conveying complex ideas - we can revisit difficult passages, cross-reference concepts, and process at our own speed. Audio shines in maintaining engagement and conveying emotion, even if the content itself is relatively simple. Perhaps the future lies not in choosing between these mediums, but in finding ways to combine their strengths. Imagine an interface that preserves the natural flow of conversation while adding the structural advantages of text - where you could navigate both temporally and conceptually, maintaining both engagement and comprehension.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As Roland Barthes suggested with &ldquo;The Death of the Author,&rdquo; once an author creates a work, the interpretation rights transfer to the readers. Video platforms feature various edited compilations, summaries, and analyses of film and television works. With improvements in constrained generative AI (voice synthesis, anime IP unification, future realistic character generation), we may see numerous derivative works based on original IPs, approaching professional quality and satisfying different interpretations and imaginations about the original work. These perspectives might all exist in the original work, but each short video offers a different angle, providing users with unique experiences.

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Effective coaching in project-based learning environments is critical for developing students’ self-regulation skills, yet scaling high-quality coaching remains a challenge. Coaches struggle to track students&rsquo; progress across multiple teams and projects, making it difficult to provide targeted feedback and adapt recommendations based on evolving student needs. Existing AI-based project management tools facilitate task tracking but fail to capture the nuanced ways students approach their work. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in analyzing text-based interactions and generating structured feedback, but their application to coaching remains underexplored.</p>
<p>This paper presents an LLM-enhanced coaching system designed to support project-based learning by helping connect peers struggling with a regulation gap to a peer who has addressed it in the past, and extracting personalized step-by-step frameworks for them to follow. Our system allows the user to record their conversation with a coach, then integrates our novel codebook, which includes regulation gap and key term definitions gathered across learning science literature, with the LLM to generate the user’s regulation gap. Utilizing the codebook and semantic matching, the system pairs one student who is currently facing that regulation gap and the other having addressed it in the past. This quarter, we explored how to facilitate conversations that will allow the novice to gain a new understanding of how to address their regulation gap, and created a tailored plan that keeps them accountable towards achieving it.</p>
<p>By utilizing LLMs throughout this system, this work advances AI-driven coaching methodologies, providing a scalable, adaptable solution for improving self-regulated learning in project-based environments. Our findings contribute to the broader field of AI-enhanced education and human-AI collaboration, offering insights into how AI can augment expert-driven mentoring in complex, open-ended learning settings.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Training college students to tackle complex, open-ended innovation work in a variety of fields such as design, entrepreneurship, and research is integral to preparing them for implementing innovative solutions upon graduation <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Project-based learning environments provide a stepping stone for preparing students to tackle complex, open-ended problems in design and research <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, yet are insufficient in helping them develop the needed regulation skills to self-direct innovation work <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. Previous research has found that college students who effectively regulate their learning have stronger problem solving skills, allowing them to succeed in innovation work <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>, <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Coaches help guide the development of these regulation skills, helping them develop cognitive, motivational, emotional, and strategic behaviors needed to problem solve and reach their desired outcomes <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. This includes assessing risks, help-seeking, understanding one’s fears and anxieties, dealing with failure, and more.</p>
<p>Effective coaching requires understanding students&rsquo; work practices, identifying gaps in their problem-solving approaches, and suggesting targeted improvements. However, coaches face significant challenges in providing personalized guidance to multiple student teams. It is difficult for coaches to assess the effectiveness of their coaching, which can result in neglected alternative practice strategies or regulation gaps. Additionally, this process of recognizing and recording students’ regulation gaps and subsequent practice strategies is time consuming, resulting in coaches becoming increasingly overwhelmed as the number of student teams grows <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>Existing AI-based project management tools like Asana and Trello help coaches track tasks and feedback through functions such as goal setting, scheduling, task monitoring, reflections, and visualizing workflows <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>. However, these tools do not capture the nuanced ways students approach their work or help coaches provide targeted, context-based guidance. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in analyzing text-based interactions and generating outputs based on multi-step reasoning, but their application to educational coaching through contextual suggestions remains unexplored. LLMs can assist in understanding unstructured input to provide feedback to coaches by analyzing student practices, identifying recurring issues, and formulating practice suggestions based on similar cases. They can automate the generation of tailored practice strategies, thus reducing the cognitive load on coaches while ensuring consistent quality of feedback <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. Furthermore, LLMs can bridge the gap between coaching sessions by delivering scaffolds and feedback to students, fostering continuous improvement in regulation skills.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we propose utilizing LLMs to develop and integrate the web application: Peer Connections, which pairs one student who is currently facing that regulation gap and the other having addressed it in the past, helps them to facilitate effective conversation which builds upon their understanding of the regulation gap and how to address it, then assist them creating a tailored plan that keeps them accountable towards achieving it.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we used a knowledge base of historical coaching cases documented through the <em>Context Assessment Plan</em> (CAP) notes from Northwestern&rsquo;s <em>Design, Technology, and Research</em> (DTR) Program (See <a href="#appendix-c">Appendix C</a>). The core idea behind these solutions is creating a system model that identifies similar notes by regulation gaps and also contextual similarity. By doing so, we can match people with similar problems for Peer Connections, as well as identify similar contextually similar cases to the one inputted and return commonly found regulation gaps and practice suggestions to achieve the Coaching Reflections and Practice Suggestions applications. We tested three different systems. First, we tested basic semantic matching using word embeddings, evaluating one version that took in the whole note, and another that weighted the semantic similarity of the regulation gap as 70%, and the rest of the note as the remaining 30%. Next, we tested the matching of notes using LLMs. We created a novel codebook consisting of tier 1 and tier 2 tags to categorize each note (See <a href="#appendix-e">Appendix E</a>). The codebook was created using a taxonomy of regulation skills and corresponding practice suggestions gathered across learning science literature <a href="#ref10">[10]</a>, <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. It also features definitions for key terms often used in the CAP notes, such as “canvas”, “slice”, “design argument”, “sprint”, and more. Utilizing prompting techniques such as few-shot learning, we utilized the LLM to identify the tier 1 and tier 2 categories of all the notes, and matched notes on the basis of having the most similar tags. Lastly, we tested a hybrid of these two systems, utilizing the LLM to incorporate the tier 1 and tier 2 tags of each as metadata to our notes, then using semantic matching to identify the most similar cases.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of these systems, we ran each model with the same three notes, and evaluated the k=5 returned similar notes. We utilized our codebook as a rubric to manually identify the tier 1 and tier 2 regulation gaps of each returned note. If the returned note had the same regulation gap as the original note, then we marked it as correct. We found that the semantic matching had significant errors when addressing emotional regulation gaps, since the terms used are often less repetitive than that used when identifying cognitive and metacognitive gaps. While the codebook prompted the LLM model showed promise in accurately identifying the regulation gaps of models, it required that we input all the notes, causing longer processing times and at times exceeding model context window. Our last model, which is a hybrid of LLMs using the codebook and semantic matching, was able to consistently and efficiently identify notes that had the same regulation gap, as well as were contextually similar. This indicates that while some changes still need to be made, we have established a working baseline model to achieve our goal of matching similar notes.</p>
<p>This quarter, we explored how to facilitate conversations that will allow the novice to gain a new understanding of how to address their regulation gap, and how to create actionable plans to hold them accountable towards doing it.</p>
<p>This paper makes the following contributions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We created a codebook consisting of regulation gap definitions and examples, drawing upon work gathered across learning science literature. Unlike existing educational taxonomies, this codebook provides structured categorization of regulation gaps through tiers 1 and 2. It synthesizes research self-regulation, scaffolding, and instructional coaching that can be utilized across a variety of use cases, such as AI-driven classification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We utilized LLMs and semantic matching to create a metadata-based note-matching system to match students with similar regulation gaps, and provide coaches with regulation gaps and practice suggestions given the issue and context of their students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We provided an empirical comparison of word embedding similarity, LLM-generated metadata, and a combined system for note retrieval, underscoring the need for a codebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We define what facilitating effective conversations between a novice peer and an experienced peer would look like, and begin to explore ways towards facilitating such conversations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This paper proceeds as follows. First, we introduce related work about AI-based coaching, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, LLMs in education, and structured coaching documentation. Then, we describe and justify our system designs, followed by our evaluation and the results of each model we tested, our preliminary user testing and results, culminating in final words about our limitations and future directions for the project.</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>
<p>Effective coaching in project-based learning environments requires identifying students&rsquo; self-regulation gaps, providing targeted feedback, and facilitating continuous improvement. Research has explored AI-driven coaching, self-regulated learning, and human-AI collaboration in education. However, existing approaches struggle to provide scalable, context-specific coaching support. Our work builds upon these research areas by integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-based analysis with structured cognitive models to enhance coaching efficacy.</p>
<p>Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been extensively studied for delivering automated feedback in structured learning domains such as mathematics and programming. These systems employ artificial intelligence techniques to provide personalized and adaptive instruction, modeling students&rsquo; psychological states, prior knowledge, skills, and preferences <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>. ITS have been widely applied in computer science education, medical training, and mathematics learning, demonstrating their ability to provide structured, task-level feedback <a href="#ref13">[13]</a>. However, while ITS excel in well-defined domains with clear problem-solving steps, they often struggle in contexts where strategies are not easily codified, such as research coaching and innovation work. AI-driven coaching systems that extend beyond traditional ITS have been developed to support open-ended learning tasks, such as entrepreneurship coaching, where metacognitive processes like problem articulation, risk assessment, and strategic planning are essential <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>. Our approach builds on these advancements by integrating LLM-driven semantic matching with structured coaching documentation, ensuring that feedback is personalized and context-aware.</p>
<p>Large language models have shown promise in augmenting human expertise across various domains, including education and coaching. LLMs can generate reflective prompts, assist with problem diagnosis, and provide personalized guidance based on historical data <a href="#ref15">[15]</a>. However, a major challenge in applying LLMs to coaching is ensuring reliability, as these models are prone to hallucinations, lack domain specificity, and struggle with contextual reasoning <a href="#ref16">[16]</a>. Recent research has sought to mitigate these challenges by grounding LLM outputs in structured cognitive models that encode domain knowledge, allowing AI-generated feedback to align more closely with expert coaching strategies <a href="#ref17">[17]</a>. Our system builds on this approach by combining LLM-driven semantic matching with structured metadata for coaching notes, ensuring that generated suggestions are not only relevant but also informed by prior cases.</p>
<p>Structured reflection tools, such as Context Assessment Plan (CAP) notes, have been widely used to document coaching insights and track student progress over time <a href="#ref18">[18]</a>. Prior research has shown that these tools enhance coaching effectiveness by making students&rsquo; learning processes more visible to mentors, facilitating more targeted and data-driven feedback. However, manually analyzing CAP notes is time-intensive and cognitively demanding, limiting the extent to which insights can be effectively leveraged across multiple coaching sessions. Existing efforts to automate aspects of coaching documentation have primarily focused on extracting key themes or summarizing student progress but have not fully addressed the challenge of identifying recurring regulation gaps and providing tailored recommendations at scale <a href="#ref19">[19]</a>. Our work builds upon CAP notes by automating similarity analysis using LLMs to identify common regulation challenges and retrieve relevant past cases that align with a student&rsquo;s current needs. This approach reduces the cognitive burden on coaches while ensuring that recommendations are grounded in expert-validated coaching strategies, making feedback more actionable and contextually relevant.</p>
<p>When having a conversation with a peer, there has also been some discourse about how to scaffold peer-questioning strategies to facilitate metacognition. The research suggests scaffolding questions that include: clarification/elaboration questions, counter-arguments, and context/perspective-oriented questions <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>. However, the most significant gap in this research was that there was no statistically significant improvement in quality of the peer-generated questions, which they attribute to two possible reasons &ldquo;(a) the scaffolds themselves may have been ineffective in supporting students to have better questioning skills; and (b) students may have needed additional training or modeling on how to use the provided scaffolds&rdquo; <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>. Thus, leaving space to explore different methods towards facilitating effective questioning, prompting, and conversation.</p>
<p>By synthesizing research on AI-based coaching, ITS, LLMs in education, and structured coaching documentation, our work introduces a hybrid LLM-coaching system that enhances scalability, adaptability, and feedback quality in project-based learning environments. Unlike prior work that focuses on either structured tutoring or broad AI-driven feedback generation, our system integrates LLM-driven semantic matching with structured cognitive models to provide adaptive, context-aware coaching support. In doing so, we extend the capabilities of AI-driven coaching by dynamically retrieving and adapting practice suggestions from historical coaching cases. We also aim to facilitate better conversations between peers, in order to allow them to address their regulation gap faster. By addressing these limitations in existing research, our work contributes to the broader field of AI-enhanced education and human-AI collaboration, demonstrating a scalable approach to improving coaching efficacy in complex, project-based learning environments.</p>
<h2 id="system-description">System Description</h2>
<p>Our system consists of three key components. First, users will be able to upload an audio recording of their conversation with the coach. Then, the user will be matched with a student who had experienced and addressed that regulation gap in the past through our student regulation gap analysis system. Lastly, our system will assist them in facilitating a conversation that guides how they will plan their next sprint.</p>
<h3 id="1-speech-to-text-transcription">1. Speech-to-text Transcription</h3>
<p>The first component of our system utilizes speech-to-text transcription with NLP-based feedback, to intake a student&rsquo;s audio recording of their conversation with the coach, allowing the system to analyze the student&rsquo;s regulation gap, while reducing the time restraints required by CAP notes.</p>
<p>

<em>Figure 1: Speech-to-text Transcription System Interface</em></p>
<h3 id="2-student-regulation-gap-analysis-system">2. Student regulation gap analysis system</h3>
<p>Thereafter, we employ a student regulation gap analysis system that leverages vector embeddings and large language models to identify patterns in student regulation behaviors across learning contexts. The system provides targeted coaching suggestions based on similar historical cases, addressing the challenge of effective coaching for developing regulation skills in design, research, and STEM innovation.</p>
<p>Our system combines semantic similarity search with LLM-based analysis in a retrieval-augmented generation approach. Initially, student regulation notes are pre-processed without a reasoning model to include metadata on tier 1 and tier 2 regulation gaps, then encoded into text embeddings. The vector database retrieves the most similar historical cases, which are then sent along with the original query to an LLM (Deepseek). The LLM generates a structured response including a diagnosis of potential regulation gaps, practice suggestions targeted to these gaps, and references to similar historical cases. This approach grounds LLM suggestions in actual coaching experiences rather than generic advice, improving the relevance and actionability of recommendations.</p>

<h4 id="i-data-preprocessing">I. Data Preprocessing</h4>
<p>We exported all existing notes from the CAP (Context-Assessment-Plan) note system and encountered several challenges during preprocessing. Many notes lacked clear assessment sections identifying regulation gaps, provided insufficient context about the student&rsquo;s situation, and used inconsistent terminology to describe similar regulation gaps. To address these issues, we removed duplicated notes and filtered out entries with incomplete fields. To better structure the data for our system, we standardized the information into several key fields.</p>
<p>These fields include a unique identifier for each case, the key learning gap identified in the assessment, additional information such as project details, title, context, and plan, the complete original coaching note, the project name, high-level regulation categories (e.g., &ldquo;Cognitive,&rdquo; &ldquo;Metacognitive&rdquo;), and more specific skill categories (e.g., &ldquo;Critical thinking,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forming feasible plans&rdquo;). The last two fields—tier1_categories and tier2_categories—were generated using the Deepseek reasoning model with a specialized regulation skills codebook that provides the conceptual backbone for our semantic matching approach.</p>

<h4 id="ii-the-regulation-skills-codebook-structured-knowledge-for-semantic-matching">II. The Regulation Skills Codebook: Structured Knowledge for Semantic Matching</h4>
<p>The core innovation of our system is the integration of a structured codebook that categorizes student regulation gaps according to a research-grounded framework. The codebook provides a hierarchical organization of regulation skills across three domains, as detailed in <a href="#appendix-e">Appendix E</a>. This framework serves as the foundation for our semantic matching system.</p>
<p>The codebook defines three main categories of regulation skills: <em>Cognitive Skills</em>, which encompass abilities for approaching problems with unknown answers; <em>Metacognitive Skills</em>, which include capacities for planning, help-seeking, collaboration, and reflection; and <em>Emotional Regulation</em>, which covers dispositions toward self and learning that affect motivation.</p>
<h4 id="iii-bridging-language-and-concepts-semantic-enrichment">III. Bridging Language and Concepts: Semantic Enrichment</h4>
<p>The codebook functions as a semantic bridge between varied descriptions of similar problems. Consider examples such as &ldquo;Student struggles to create clear visual representations of system architecture&rdquo; (categorized as Cognitive &gt; Representing problem and solution spaces), &ldquo;Prototype missing key feature&rdquo; (also Cognitive &gt; Representing problem and solution spaces), &ldquo;Not slicing work to risk&rdquo; (Metacognitive &gt; Planning effective iterations), and &ldquo;Student gets stuck and then stops thinking about strategy&rdquo; (Emotional &gt; Embracing challenges/learning/independence). Even without textual similarity, the codebook categorization reveals conceptual relationships. For instance, &ldquo;stopping too soon with examples&rdquo; and &ldquo;not thinking deeply about risks&rdquo; would both be categorized under &ldquo;Critical thinking and argumentation,&rdquo; enabling the system to recognize their conceptual similarity despite different phrasing.</p>
<p>This structured approach provides several advantages. It standardizes vocabulary across different coaching contexts, reveals underlying patterns in student regulation behavior, enables transfer of coaching knowledge across project domains, and prioritizes skill-based similarity over surface-level textual matching.</p>

<h4 id="iv-similarity-methods-for-regulation-gap-analysis">IV. Similarity Methods for Regulation Gap Analysis</h4>
<p>To find cases with the same regulation gaps, we started with the semantic-based approach and gradually enhanced our methods. Our initial baseline approach uses vector embeddings to find similar cases based on textual similarity. We encode the full text of student issues using OpenAI&rsquo;s ada-002 embedding model and compare them using cosine similarity. This pure semantic similarity approach treats all text equally and serves as a useful baseline. However, while straightforward, this approach often prioritizes surface-level similarities like project domain rather than underlying regulation patterns.</p>
<p>To improve matching relevance, we enhanced our approach by separating the regulation gap description from contextual information, applying higher weight to the gap text (default: 0.7 for regulation gap, 0.3 for other content). The gap text often contains the most critical information about the learning challenge, so it deserves higher weight. This weighted semantic similarity approach better identifies regulation similarities even when project contexts differ, as it emphasizes the specific regulation gap rather than surrounding information.</p>
<p>However, we also realized limitations with the semantic-based matching methods, namely that semantic similarity only worked when there were apparent keywords to match. To address this limitation, we created a comprehensive codebook containing regulation gap definitions and examples, using a reasoning model (Deepseek-reasoning) to generate metadata with tier 1 and tier 2 regulation gap tags for enhanced matching. This LLM reasoning with codebook approach assigns the highest weight (0.5) to tier 2 categories and a lower weight (0.1) to tier 1 categories, with gap text and other content each receiving 0.2 weight. This metadata represents specific regulation skills, allowing the system to match cases addressing similar skills regardless of how they&rsquo;re described or in what context they appear.</p>
<h4 id="v-applying-the-codebook-in-evaluation-scripts">V. Applying the Codebook in Evaluation Scripts</h4>
<p>The codebook plays a crucial role in the tiered similarity evaluation methods. The categorization process begins with the categorize_regulation_gaps_deepseek_v0.2.py script, which uses the codebook definitions to classify each gap text into tier 1 and tier 2 categories. Each gap is analyzed against the codebook&rsquo;s framework, identifying which cognitive, metacognitive, or emotional regulation skills are being addressed. These categorizations are then stored in the tiered_weighted_cases.json file as structured metadata for later retrieval and analysis.</p>
<p>The codebook improves evaluation outcomes in several important ways. It provides a standardized vocabulary with a consistent framework of terms and concepts, helping to match cases that use different wording but address the same underlying skills. It enables contextual understanding by categorizing gaps according to the codebook, allowing the system to understand the deeper educational context beyond surface-level language similarities. The codebook&rsquo;s three-category structure (cognitive, metacognitive, emotional) aligns with research on key regulation skills central to the situated practice system, providing coaching concept integration. Even when projects differ completely, the codebook categories help identify transferable skills and learning patterns across domains, enabling cross-project relevance. The higher weight given to tier 2 categories (0.5) in the tiered similarity approach reflects their importance in precisely identifying the specific skill gaps being addressed.</p>
<p>For instance, when processing a gap like &ldquo;stopping too soon with examples,&rdquo; without the codebook approach, the system might only match cases with similar phrasing about &ldquo;stopping&rdquo; or &ldquo;examples.&rdquo; With the codebook integration, this gap is properly categorized as &ldquo;Cognitive &gt; Critical thinking and argumentation,&rdquo; allowing matches to conceptually similar gaps like &ldquo;not thinking deeply enough about risks&rdquo; even when the phrasing differs completely.</p>
<h3 id="3-facilitating-conversation-and-formulating-tailored-plans">3. Facilitating Conversation and Formulating Tailored Plans</h3>
<p>To generate helpful and contextualized conversation facilitation questions, we created a codebook based on Choi et al.&rsquo;s question methodology, then prompted an LLM  to generate responses based on conversation context (streamed) and codebook <a href="#ref20">[20]</a> (See <a href="#appendix-f">Appendix F</a>). The codebook and question generation is still within its early stages, until we conduct more user testing to discover the most pertinent questions to ask. Additionally, while not implemented yet, formulating tailored plans would take place in the form of filling out their sprint log/plan for their week, which they would be either linked to or the system will parse it into the sheet for them. This will allow them to enact their plans to address their regulation gap while still incorporating the tasks they need to complete for the week.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/llmcoaching/figure4.png" alt="Discussion Questions Interface" loading="lazy">
 
<em>Figure 4: Suggested Discussion Questions</em></p>
<h2 id="study--experiment--deployment">Study / Experiment / Deployment</h2>
<p>We conducted manual qualitative coding on a set of 28 CAP notes utilizing our codebook definitions to use as ground truth to evaluate our model against. When comparing our tier 2 codes on these notes with the codes given by our system, we observed a precision of 0.875, and a recall of 0.893. Given the possible subjectivity and overlap of regulation gaps, these results suggest we can rely on our system to accurately categorize student cases’ regulation gaps.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated how to facilitate effective conversation between the peers once they are matched. Most notably, how do we define what an “effective” conversation looks like?</p>
<p>To begin, we conducted some casual conversations with peers in the DTR program, asking them to explain about an issue they struggled with in the past, and how they were able to overcome it. Our conversations had no structure, as it was just to give us an idea of how students talked about regulation with a peer. From this preliminary research, we observed the main finding that experienced students struggle to articulate their experience in a way that is helpful to the peer. This is due to several factors:</p>
<p>A lack of project context/terminology
Not articulating their experience addressing the regulation gap in a step-by-step, clear way, making it hard for the peer to abstract their thinking process into a high-level framework they could use
Both peers have trouble remembering what they experienced and what actionable next steps to take</p>
<p>Based upon these findings, we defined an &ldquo;effective&rdquo; conversation to be one that helps them create a more concrete, actionable plan than they had before, and that they actually implement this and solve their regulation gap faster. We then identified this causal structure for which to guide our prototype and user testing:</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/llmcoaching/diagram.png" alt="Causal Structure Diagram" loading="lazy">
 
<em>Figure: Causal structure diagram showing the relationship between peer conversations and regulation gap resolution</em></p>
<p>Given this causal diagram, we set up a second, more formal user testing scenario. Given the work of Choi et al., which highlights how scaffolding peer-questioning strategies can help facilitate metacognition, we formulated a list of questions that fell under the clarification/elaboration and ⁠⁠context/perspective-oriented categories suggested in the paper <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>. We created two lists of questions, one for the novice and one for the experienced peer, to guide the conversation, in the goal of assisting the experienced peer in articulating their experience in a step-by-step manner, and helping the novice understand how they can apply this to their own situation (See <a href="#appendix-g">Appendix G</a>).</p>
<p>We then conducted some preliminary user testing, by having one of us act as the experienced peer, and having another student in DTR be the novice. We simulated the conversation by having the novice ask us the questions provided in the scaffold, while we acted as the experienced peer answering the questions and providing advice. To qualitatively assess how the conversation influenced the peer, we asked them the same questions before and after (See <a href="#appendix-h">Appendix H</a>). During one of our user tests, one of our users, who struggled with the fear of imperfection, demonstrated this transformation:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Before peer conversation</th>
          <th>After peer conversation</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>&ldquo;I have no time to get things done, since my internship is starting tomorrow. There&rsquo;s a 6/10 chance that I actually take the steps I know I need to take, and actually I think it&rsquo;s even lower.&rdquo;</td>
          <td>&ldquo;You know what, I&rsquo;m gonna send this to my partner first, and then I&rsquo;m gonna send this to Haoqi.&rdquo;</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This illustrates multiple findings, first that the student shifted their mindset towards already deciding that she wasn&rsquo;t going to get what she wanted to do, despite not having started yet, to taking actionable steps towards working on her project and addressing her regulation gap. Furthermore, the student changed the steps they were going to dedicate time halfway between her tasks for the week to send deliverables over to the coach. The next step would be to follow up and see if this was accomplished, and how it affected her project outcome and regulation.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Our system effectively facilitates AI-enhanced coaching by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and structured metadata to support project-based learning environments. By integrating semantic matching with structured codebook metadata, our approach identifies relevant coaching cases, reducing cognitive load on mentors while maintaining high-quality, context-aware feedback. We also began to explore how to facilitate effective and productive conversation amongst peers about regulation gaps. This discussion outlines the generalizable design elements and techniques that contributed to the prototype’s effectiveness, highlighting key takeaways for future socio-technical system development.
<strong>Hybrid AI-Driven Case Retrieval:</strong> Our system employs a hybrid approach that combines LLM-driven metadata tagging with traditional semantic matching. While pure semantic similarity methods struggled to capture nuanced regulation gaps due to limited repetitive terminology, and LLM-based approaches returned too many broadly relevant cases, integrating both techniques enabled <em>precision</em> in retrieving the most relevant coaching cases. This demonstrates the efficacy of hybrid AI-driven retrieval in domains where contextual similarity and structured knowledge are both crucial. Future systems designed for education or expert-driven fields can benefit from this combined methodology to ensure both relevance and specificity in recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Codebooks for Domain-Specific AI Applications:</strong> A key enabler of our system&rsquo;s success was the development of a structured codebook that categorizes regulation gaps into tiered classifications, allowing advanced reasoning models to more accurately categorize regulation gaps. By leveraging <em>cognitive</em>, <em>metacognitive</em>, and <em>emotional</em> regulation categories, the system grounded LLM-based reasoning in expert-validated pedagogical frameworks and effectively addresses the issue of LLM hallucinations. The implication for broader AI applications is that structured codebooks can serve as a mechanism to guide AI reasoning, especially for test time scaled models, and in fields requiring human-like judgment and contextual understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffolding productive conversations for addressing regulation gaps:</strong> Providing enough context and terminology of the other&rsquo;s project and issue is crucial to set them up for success. Additionally, adopting peer-questioning scaffolds assists in driving a conversation where the more experienced peer can better articulate and reflect upon their step-by-step strategy to addressing their regulation gap, which can be adapted and applied by the novice.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work</h2>
<p>There are inherent limitations in our current approach that necessitate attention. The CAP note system is succinctly written and does not always provide sufficient context for robust reasoning. Additionally, our codebook currently focuses primarily on high-level descriptions of regulation gaps along with their examples, which makes it difficult for the language model to develop domain-specific knowledge and reasoning for effective categorization.
To address these limitations and plan for iterative improvements, we will work with CAP note developers to identify ways toward either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving clarity of writing in notes</li>
<li>Collecting more data through alternative data sources (SIG meeting transcripts, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For future work, we propose developing a sub-categorized codebook that further segments existing regulation gaps and contains specific examples along with reasoning chains for arriving at regulation gap categorizations. With such a codebook, we can first perform a tier 1 categorization of the gap to route to a corresponding model identifying each of the subcategories for further reasoning (using two sets of language models and corresponding reasoning prompts) for few-shot learning and prompt-based LLM-enabled categorization.</p>
<p>As LLMs continue to progress, we believe there is merit in more sophisticated reasoning methods such as the use of external knowledge bases or memory systems for persistent storage of student regulation gap progression. These approaches could enable more tailored and precise gap understanding, ultimately leading to more effective coaching support for developing regulation skills in design, research, and STEM innovation contexts.</p>
<p>In terms of facilitating effective conversation between peers, we plan to continually design testing strategies of feature slices, focusing on evaluating what intervention strategies are most effective in facilitating peers to more clearly articulate and discuss their task plans in context of their regulation gaps, thereby facilitating meaningful peer to peer interaction enabling effective regulation skill learning. This involves testing whether real time generation of follow up questions for explanation elaboration or regulation skill connection allows better articulation of questions during peer to peer conversations, as well as whether more context regarding the peer’s project and regulation skills should be provided in advance to foster more meaningful conversations grounded in discussion of actionable next steps for regulation skill learning.</p>
<p>Most notably, there is still more work to be done with testing these strategies, specifically figuring out how to ensure that it impacts students not just in the moment, but in the long-term. To do so, we plan to run formal user tests which both qualitatively and quantitatively examine how they will and if they are addressing their regulation gap, by surveying them before using the prototype and having the conversation, after, and the subsequent weeks.</p>

<p>Prompting of the LLM with the codebook incorporated.</p>
<p>“You are an expert in analyzing student regulation gaps. You need to categorize each CAP (Context, Assessment, Plan) note into these three tier 1 categories and their corresponding tier 2 categories. Each case may be categorized into multiple tier 1 and tier 2 categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cognitive: The student lacks skills for approaching problems with an unknown answer, or even, knowing what the problem is exactly. This includes:
Representing problem and solution spaces: The way the student structures or presents the information is not effectively supporting reasoning, analysis, or communication.
Example: Jacob struggles to create a representation that would help him show a working example and an example where the system breaks.
Assessing risks: The student struggles with identifying the riskiest risks and/or prioritizing them. They may skip ahead, do unnecessary and unimportant tasks, or have impractical plans due to not properly addressing and prioritizing the risk.
Example: John wasted time jumping ahead (he created multiple very detailed mockups) when he should’ve been focusing on addressing the riskiest risk at hand, which was identifying his target audience.
Critical thinking and argumentation: The student struggles to construct well-reasoned arguments supported by evidence or lacks a conceptual understanding of the task at hand. They might find it difficult to identify conceptual differences (they are treating concepts as too similar when they actually have meaningful differences).
Example: Eloise isn’t fully understanding what a regulation gap is and how to distinguish between the different types, and keeps taking the wrong changes to her prototypes because of that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metacognitive: The student struggles in areas of planning, help-seeking and collaboration, and reflection. This includes:
Forming feasible plans: The student struggles to develop structured, realistic, and actionable plans. This could include what their outcome should be and how to measure their outcome.
Example: Penelope overloaded herself with tasks this sprint and while she got a lot of it done, it wasn’t good work.
Planning effective iterations: The student struggles to create a deliverable that addresses the sprint’s riskiest risk. The student may struggle due to problems with slicing (breaking larger problems down), prioritization, or understanding the problem.
Example: David didn’t incorporate the feedback the coach gave him last week, so his work this week was not effective.
Leveraging resources and seeking help: The skill of identifying and utilizing available materials, expertise from others, and information to enhance their learning and problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotional: The student has regulation and dispositions toward self and learning that affects their motivation, cognition, and metacognition. This includes:
Fears and anxieties: The student may have a fear of imperfection which causes them to shy away from the work, and/or doesn’t want to try things themselves.
Example: Jennifer had a well-planned sprint to carry out, but got too caught up trying to perfectly design the solution rather than creating a first prototype.
Embracing challenges and learning: The student tries to brute force their way through a solution or runs away from it, rather than thinking about the strategy and approach.
Example: Riley&rsquo;s system was not producing her optimal output, so she tried to overfit on one example rather than take a step back and observe what patterns are causing the system to fail.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the regulation gap (assessment), issue title, and context provided, categorize this case any categories (can be multiple) it applies to (Cognitive, Metacognitive, or Emotional).</p>
<p>To help you understand the notes better, here are some definitions of key terms:
Slice: A well-defined, manageable portion of a larger task or goal that can be completed within a short timeframe (typically a week), contributing to incremental progress.
Sprint: A time-boxed, iterative work cycle in agile project management, typically lasting 2 weeks, during which a team completes a set amount of work toward a project goal. Sprints emphasize rapid progress, continuous feedback, and adaptability.
Mysore: A structured learning and practice time where students work on their projects while a mentor provides feedback.
SIG: Special Interest Group meetings (SIG meetings) bring together undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty working on different projects in the same research area. Each SIG is its own mini-studio initially led by a faculty member whose leadership fades over time as a graduate student SIG lead gains competencies in mentoring and becomes the leader of their own SIG. At the start of a sprint, teams share the outcome of their last sprint and present their current sprint plans for review. Halfway through a sprint, teams present their progress and SIG members help devise strategies for overcoming blockers.</p>
<p>Categorization should be based 80% on the “Assessment” part of the note, as this is the coach’s perceived regulation gap. Be careful not to get confused-you should be categorizing their regulation gap, not the implications of the regulation gap. For instance, let’s take a look at this CAP note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Student: Improving and Scaling LLMs for Coaching
Improving and Scaling LLMs for Coaching | 2025-02-01
Items of Concern: Really hard to see how the conceptual examples would work / workout
Context: - Not sure why a lot of the categories are there.. not sure how they are actually relevant and what you learned from the analysis
Assessment: - Analysis not quite showing <em>why</em> the system suggested/showed what it showed?
Practice Suggestions: - [self-work] I couldn&rsquo;t tell from the output examples <em>why</em> the system was generating what it was generating. Can you think about a representation that would help you show, for an example category that you think are good and one that isn&rsquo;t, <em>why</em> the system got it right or wrong? Perhaps you can do this by showing component TF-IDF scores for each term, and also by showing some of the matching regulation gaps?&rdquo;
Looking at the note as a whole, one might identify it under the tier 2 Representing problem and solution spaces, Critical thinking and argumentation, Forming feasible plans, and Planning effective iterations. However, forming feasible plans and planning effective iterations were identified from the “practice suggestions” section, meaning that this is an implication of the regulation gap rather than the regulation gap itself.</p>
<p>In this case, the correct tier 2 categorization of the regulation gap would be Representing problem and solution spaces and Critical thinking and argumentation based on the “assessment” section.</p>
<p>Provide your reasoning and then your final category choice in this format:
Reasoning: [your step-by-step reasoning]
Categories: [tier 1 category name] [tier 2 category name]”</p>

<h2 id="from-llms-to-agents">From LLMs to Agents</h2>
<p>The transition from LLMs to Agents has become a consensus in the AI community, representing an improvement in complex task execution capabilities. However, helping users fully utilize Agent capabilities to achieve tenfold efficiency gains requires careful workflow design. These workflows aren&rsquo;t merely a presentation of parallel capabilities, but seamless integrations with human-in-the-loop quality assurance. This document uses Typeface as a reference to explain why a clear primary workflow is necessary, as well as design approaches for functional extensions.</p>
<h2 id="from-google-next-to-baidu-create">From Google Next to Baidu Create</h2>
<p>Google held its Google Cloud Next conference from April 9-11, announcing products like Google Vids, Gemini, Vertex AI, and related updates.</p>
<p>From a consumer product perspective, despite Google releasing many products, they were relatively superficial (Google Vids, Workspace AI, etc.). Examples like their Sales Agent demonstration were awkward in workflow, similar to Amazon Rufus. However, the enhanced data insight capabilities enabled by long context windows are becoming a confirmed trend.</p>
<p>From a business product perspective, while Google showcased many Agent applications built on Gemini and Vertex AI and emphasized their powerful functionality, they glossed over the difficulties of actual deployment. Currently, both large tech companies and traditional businesses face challenges in implementing truly effective workflows.</p>
<p>LLMs deliver not just tools, but work results at specific stages of a process. Application deployment can be viewed as providing models with specific contexts and clear behavioral standards. The understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be applied to various scenarios; packaging general capabilities as abilities needed for specific positions or processes involves overlaying domain expertise with general intelligence.</p>
<p>We should look beyond ChatBot and Agent dimensions to view applications from a Workflow perspective. What parts of daily workflows can be taken over by LLMs? If large models need to process certain enterprise data, what value does this data provide in the business? Where does it sit in the value chain? In the current operational model, which links could be replaced with large models?</p>
<h2 id="11-consensus-task-specific-moe-agents-routing">1.1 Consensus: Task Specific, MoE, Agents, Routing</h2>
<p>Content that has reached consensus:</p>
<p>Most companies (A12Labs, Anthropic, etc.) are now developing Task Specific models and Mixture of Experts architectures. The MoE architecture has been widely applied in natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and other fields. It can improve model flexibility and scalability while reducing parameters and computational requirements, thereby enhancing model efficiency and generalization ability (Mixture of Experts Explained).</p>
<p>The MoE (Mixture of Experts) architecture is a deep learning model structure composed of multiple expert networks, each responsible for handling specific tasks or datasets. In an MoE architecture, input data is assigned to different expert networks for processing, each returning an output structure, with the final output being a weighted sum of all expert network outputs.</p>
<p>The core idea of MoE architecture is to break down a large, complex task into multiple smaller, simpler tasks, with different expert networks handling different tasks. This improves model flexibility and scalability while reducing parameters and computational requirements, enhancing efficiency and generalization capability.</p>
<p>Implementing an MoE architecture typically requires the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define expert networks: First, define multiple expert networks, each responsible for handling specific tasks or datasets. These expert networks can be different deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train expert networks: Use labeled training data to train each expert network to obtain weights and parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate data: During training, input data needs to be allocated to different expert networks for processing. Data allocation methods can be random, task-based, data-based, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summarize results: Weight and sum the output results of each expert network to get the final output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train the model: Use labeled training data to train the entire MoE architecture to obtain final model weights and parameters.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="22-improving-agent-user-experience">2.2 Improving Agent User Experience</h3>
<h4 id="personalized-memory--style-customization">Personalized Memory &amp; Style Customization</h4>
<p>User Need: Adjusting generation style through prompts before each generation is time-consuming and unpredictable. A comprehensive set of generation rules can help ensure that generated content consistently meets user needs, avoiding repeated adjustments.
Example: Typeface Brand Kit</p>
<h4 id="rewind--edit">Rewind &amp; Edit</h4>
<p>User Need: From a probability perspective, the accuracy of Agent Chaining decreases progressively. Setting up human-in-the-loop processes allows users to regenerate or fine-tune after each step, helping ensure final generation quality.
Example: Typeface Projects (also includes Magic Prompt to assist with prompt generation)</p>
<h4 id="choose-from-variations">Choose from Variations</h4>
<p>User Need: Users want options. In existing generation processes, if users are dissatisfied with generated content, they need to refresh the generation, which is inefficient. Providing multiple options in a single generation can improve user experience.
Example: Typeface Image Generator (also supports favoriting)</p>
<h4 id="workflows-not-skills">Workflows, Not Skills</h4>
<p>User Need: Currently, some users need to use 5-10 AI capabilities to complete advertising video creation. Most capabilities are disconnected, requiring frequent switching. By establishing a clear workflow, users can more efficiently invoke relevant tools to complete their creation.
Example: Typeface Workflow (all capabilities presented at the appropriate stages)</p>

<h3 id="32-feature-breakdown---customized-content-generation-for-brands">3.2 Feature Breakdown - Customized Content Generation for Brands</h3>
<p>Multiple Agent calls centered around the core document editing experience.</p>
<p>When users log into the Typeface homepage, they see four core functions in the left toolbar (Projects, Templates, Brands, Audience). The main page shows corresponding workflow options (Create a product shot, generate some text, etc.). The Getting Started Guide at the bottom of the main page provides guidance videos for certain use cases (Set up brand kit, repurpose videos into text) to help users understand how to invoke various capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features:</h4>
<h5 id="brands">Brands</h5>
<p>When users click to enter the Brands page, they can set up multiple Brand generation rules, divided into 3 items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image Styles: Users can upload existing images for subsequent generation style adjustment.</li>
<li>Color Palettes: Users can upload brand color palettes to standardize generated image colors.</li>
<li>Brand Voice: Users can directly upload existing brand introductions/Blog URLs or copy a 500-1000 word passage. Typeface analyzes the content and formulates a series of brand values and tones, finally combining them with user-set hard rules to ensure each generation conforms to the brand image.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="projects">Projects</h5>
<p>When users click to enter the Projects page, they see a Google Doc-like interface storing multiple projects. Each project opens to a main document page with a resizable input bar at the bottom. Clicking the input bar presents options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new image</li>
<li>Create a product shot</li>
<li>Generate text</li>
<li>Create from template</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, users can select Refine to adjust generation language and tone (fixed options).</p>
<h5 id="create-an-image">Create an Image</h5>
<p>After clicking Create an image, users enter the image editing page with six integrated functions on the left: &ldquo;Add, select, extend, lighting, color, effects, adobe express.&rdquo; Users can generate and adjust images directly and favorite preferred generations.</p>
<h5 id="create-a-product-shot">Create a Product Shot</h5>
<p>The difference from Create an image is that Product shot includes specific products, while image isn&rsquo;t necessarily product-related.</p>
<h5 id="generate-text">Generate Text</h5>
<p>After clicking Generate text, users enter a prompt input field. Clicking the settings icon in the upper right allows setting Target Audience and Brand Kit. After generation, users can further adjust the prompt for a second generation, and selected content appears in the Project docs.</p>
<h5 id="templates">Templates</h5>
<p>Typeface offers various generation templates. Users can search and select from the Template library, which adjusts the input box according to the content template, like TikTok Script.</p>
<h5 id="audiences">Audiences</h5>
<p>When generating content, users can select user profiles and set Age Range, Gender, Interest or preference, and Spending behavior (with fixed options).</p>
<h5 id="integrations">Integrations</h5>
<p>These integrations allow users to create in their familiar workspaces, avoiding the friction of cross-platform collaboration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.typeface.ai/product/integrations">https://www.typeface.ai/product/integrations</a></p>

<h2 id="tiktok-insight-spotlight-launches-at-advertiser-summit">TikTok Insight Spotlight Launches at Advertiser Summit</h2>
<p>Jun 3 - Excited to share that TikTok Insight Spotlight, a product I worked on during my time at TikTok, was officially unveiled at the company&rsquo;s annual advertiser summit on June 3rd, 2025. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678255/tiktok-advertiser-summit-ai-targeting-data-seo">The Verge covered the launch extensively</a>, highlighting the AI-driven capabilities I helped develop.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/docs/images/projects/insight/insight_spotlight.jpeg" alt="TikTok Insight Spotlight Interface" loading="lazy">
 
<em>TikTok&rsquo;s Insight Spotlight interface showing AI-generated analysis - a product I contributed to while at TikTok</em></p>
<p>As The Verge reported: &ldquo;TikTok introduced a slew of new advertiser tools at the company&rsquo;s annual advertiser summit on June 3rd. The new products range from AI-powered ad tools to new features connecting creators and brands, but the overall picture is clear: advertiser content on TikTok is about to become much more tailored and specific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The article specifically highlighted the core functionality I worked on: &ldquo;The company will give brands precise details about how their target audience is using the platform — including AI-generated suggestions on ads to run. Using a tool called Insight Spotlight, advertisers will be able to sort by user demographics and industry to see what videos users in the target group are watching and what keywords are associated with popular content.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-product">Behind the Product:</h2>
<p>During my time at TikTok, I worked specifically on the multi-modal content understanding capabilities that power Insight Spotlight&rsquo;s core functionality. Here&rsquo;s how the features I helped develop work in practice:</p>
<h3 id="ai-generated-content-recommendations">AI-Generated Content Recommendations</h3>
<p>The Verge highlighted a key example of the system in action: &ldquo;In an example provided by TikTok, an AI-generated suggestion recommends that a brand &lsquo;produce video content focused on &lsquo;hormonal health&rsquo; for female, English-speaking users&rsquo; and to include a specific keyword.&rdquo; This type of precise, data-driven recommendation is made possible by the multi-modal analysis systems I contributed to.</p>
<h3 id="trend-prediction-through-content-analysis">Trend Prediction Through Content Analysis</h3>
<p>As The Verge noted: &ldquo;Another feature in Insight Spotlight analyzes users&rsquo; viewing history to identify types of content that are bubbling up.&rdquo; This capability stems from the advanced content understanding work I did, which enables the system to analyze both visual and audio elements of videos to predict emerging trends before they become mainstream.</p>
<p>The article captures the significance of this shift: &ldquo;TikTok rose in prominence partly because of its spin-the-wheel, seemingly random quality: anything or anyone could go viral overnight. Brands did their best to keep up by jumping on trends, using popular formats and songs, and partnered with influencers who seemed to be at the center. The new tools will give advertisers even more ways to specifically tailor their content toward what is already happening on the platform and what people are searching for and watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My work on multi-modal content understanding was focused on making this transition from random virality to predictable, data-driven insights possible. By analyzing thousands of TikToks across visual, audio, and textual dimensions, we created a system that can identify patterns and provide actionable recommendations to advertisers.</p>
<h3 id="platform-as-search-engine-vision">Platform-as-Search-Engine Vision</h3>
<p>The Verge perfectly captured the broader vision: &ldquo;In this way, advertiser tools are TikTok&rsquo;s equivalent of search engine optimization (SEO) — flooding the zone with content that attempts to capture organic user behaviors. The idea that TikTok can be used as a search engine has been around for several years, and the company says that one in four users search for something within 30 seconds of opening the app.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This transformation from entertainment platform to search-driven insights tool represents our team&rsquo;s work - using AI to understand not just what content performs, but why it performs and how brands can leverage those insights.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-data-the-evolution-of-ai-driven-insight-products-for-content-creation">Beyond Data: The Evolution of AI-Driven Insight Products for Content Creation</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-the-shifting-landscape-of-creative-ai-tools">Introduction: The Shifting Landscape of Creative AI Tools</h2>
<p>In the rapidly evolving space of AI-driven creative tools, we&rsquo;re witnessing a significant transition from general-purpose large language models to specialized, task-specific agent systems. This shift represents a fundamental change in how AI approaches creative work, particularly in advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>While many current GenAI applications focus heavily on content generation capabilities, the true creative bottleneck often isn&rsquo;t in the generation step itself. Rather, it lies in the quality of insights that inform and guide the creative process. Without meaningful data and analysis, even the most sophisticated generation tools produce generic, uninspired content.</p>
<p>This blog explores how data insight products are evolving alongside generative AI technologies, and how their integration could fundamentally transform content creation workflows.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-ai-capabilities">The Evolution of AI Capabilities</h2>
<p>The limitations of general-purpose large language models have become increasingly apparent when handling complex creative tasks. To address issues like hallucinations and improve task completion capabilities, the industry has largely reached a consensus around agent-based approaches.</p>
<p>Different types of agent workflows have emerged to address specific needs. Non-agentic workflows generate content linearly without backtracking, suitable for straightforward tasks. Reflection-based systems introduce iterative improvement cycles where the AI criticizes and refines its own outputs. Tool use capabilities enable function calls and web browsing for enhanced research capabilities.</p>
<p>More advanced systems implement planning algorithms that decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, similar to how human creators break down projects. At the frontier, multi-agent collaboration enables specialized AI agents to work together, each handling different aspects of a complex creative process.</p>
<p>This evolution toward more sophisticated agent architectures reflects a growing understanding that creative work isn&rsquo;t linear—it requires iteration, refinement, and the ability to leverage different capabilities at different stages of the process.</p>
<h2 id="the-workflow-challenge">The Workflow Challenge</h2>
<p>One of the key limitations in current AI creative products is their focus on isolated capabilities rather than integrated workflows. In the advertising and marketing industry, there&rsquo;s a high concentration of AI tools, but most provide only single functions or partial capabilities.</p>
<p>A content creator typically needs to move through multiple stages: gathering insights, analyzing competitors, developing concepts, generating scripts, creating visual assets, and optimizing the final product. Currently, this requires juggling multiple disconnected tools, manually transferring context between them, and piecing together a cohesive workflow.</p>
<p>Users don&rsquo;t simply need better individual tools—they need comprehensive workflows that connect these steps seamlessly. The value proposition shifts from &ldquo;what can this AI do?&rdquo; to &ldquo;how does this AI fit into my creative process?&rdquo; This represents a fundamental shift in how we should design and evaluate AI creative systems.</p>
<h2 id="market-analysis-of-insight-products">Market Analysis of Insight Products</h2>
<p>The current market for insight products shows several distinct categories, each addressing different aspects of the creative process. Here&rsquo;s a structured analysis of the landscape:</p>
<h3 id="ad-compilation-tools">Ad Compilation Tools</h3>
<p>Products in this category focus on collecting, organizing, and analyzing existing advertisements across platforms. Pipi Ads maintains a library of over 20 million TikTok ads with extensive filtering capabilities, allowing users to study successful campaigns and identify trending approaches. Foreplay offers a more workflow-oriented solution, enabling users to save ads from multiple platforms, organize them with custom tags, and build creative briefs based on existing successful content.</p>
<p>The value proposition of these tools centers on learning from what already works. By studying high-performing ads, creators can identify patterns and strategies that resonate with specific audiences. However, most of these tools stop at the analysis stage without directly connecting insights to content generation.</p>
<h3 id="competitor-analysis-tools">Competitor Analysis Tools</h3>
<p>Tools like Social Peta, Big Spy, and Story Clash provide deeper analysis of competitive activities. Social Peta offers insights into content distribution across 69 countries and 70 networks, analyzing multimedia types and dimensions. Big Spy enables cross-network ad searching with multiple filters, while Story Clash specializes in TikTok influencer tracking and performance analysis.</p>
<p>The competitive analysis market has grown substantially with the rise of social media advertising, with new players continuously entering the space to address specialized niches and platforms. These tools typically provide dashboard interfaces with various filters for monitoring competitor strategies, but most lack direct integration with content creation workflows.</p>
<h3 id="brand-insight-tools">Brand Insight Tools</h3>
<p>Social listening platforms like Springklr, Exolyt, and Keyhole monitor brand mentions and sentiment across social channels. These tools analyze both posts and comments, providing valuable data on how audiences perceive brands and their content. Springklr offers comprehensive post and comment analysis with sentiment tracking, while Exolyt specializes in TikTok-specific insights, comparing brand content with user-generated content.</p>
<p>Keyhole delivers profile analytics, social trend monitoring, and campaign tracking. These tools excel at capturing the audience&rsquo;s voice and identifying shifts in perception, but typically require significant manual analysis to translate these insights into actionable creative strategies.</p>
<h3 id="performance-analysis-tools">Performance Analysis Tools</h3>
<p>Platforms such as Social Insider, Motion App, and RivalQ focus on analyzing ad performance metrics. These tools help marketers understand what content performs best, with detailed analytics on engagement, conversion, and return on investment. By identifying high-performing content patterns, these tools can inform future creative decisions.</p>
<p>However, there remains a significant gap between identifying what works and automatically generating new content based on those insights. Most performance analysis tools remain separated from content creation workflows, requiring manual interpretation and application of insights.</p>
<h2 id="deep-dive-notable-products">Deep Dive: Notable Products</h2>
<p>Several standout products illustrate different approaches to the insight-generation challenge:</p>
<h3 id="tikbuddy-platform-specific-analysis">TikBuddy: Platform-Specific Analysis</h3>
<p>TikBuddy focuses exclusively on TikTok analytics, offering creator rankings by category, follower count, and growth rate. The tool provides comprehensive account performance monitoring and video data analysis through a convenient Chrome extension.</p>
<p>Its specialized focus allows for deeper platform-specific insights, but its utility is limited to a single platform and doesn&rsquo;t extend to content creation. Users must manually apply any insights gained to their creative process.</p>
<h3 id="foreplay-workflow-integration">Foreplay: Workflow Integration</h3>
<p>Foreplay stands out for its more integrated workflow approach. The platform enables users to collect ad content across platforms, preserve it even after platform deletion, and organize it with tags and categories. Its brief creation tools facilitate the transition from insight to execution, with support for brand information and specific generation requirements.</p>
<p>The platform&rsquo;s AI storyboard generator creates hooks and develops scripts based on collected insights. Foreplay also integrates discovery features organized by community, brand, and experts, alongside competitor monitoring capabilities.</p>
<p>This approach begins to bridge the gap between insights and creation, though the integration remains partial rather than fully automated.</p>
<h3 id="keyhole-deep-analytics">Keyhole: Deep Analytics</h3>
<p>Keyhole exemplifies the analytics-focused approach, tracking keywords and brand mentions with temporal context. The platform offers detailed post analysis, influencer identification, trending topics visualization, and profile analytics with optimization recommendations.</p>
<p>Its strength lies in comprehensive data collection and visualization, but like many analytics platforms, it requires significant human interpretation to translate insights into creative decisions.</p>
<h2 id="emerging-innovations-in-data-insight-products">Emerging Innovations in Data Insight Products</h2>
<p>The data insight landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with several notable innovations emerging:</p>
<p>Open source projects like Vanna are revolutionizing text-to-SQL capabilities, making database querying more accessible to non-technical users. These tools enable creators to extract specific insights from complex datasets without specialized database knowledge.</p>
<p>Recent startups are developing interactive data dashboards that visualize complex datasets in more intuitive ways, allowing for easier pattern identification and insight extraction. These tools employ advanced visualization techniques to make data more accessible and actionable.</p>
<p>User feedback aggregation tools are also gaining traction, automatically summarizing and categorizing customer sentiment from reviews and comments. These systems can identify common themes and concerns, providing valuable input for content creators looking to address audience needs.</p>
<p>The most promising innovations focus on reducing the cognitive load required to extract meaningful insights from data, making the path from analysis to action more direct and intuitive.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-insight-driven-content-generation">The Future: Insight-Driven Content Generation</h2>
<p>The next evolution in creative AI tools will likely center on high-quality content generation based on data insights. Current GenAI applications often produce unnecessary content redundancy—different from hallucinations, but equally problematic for effective communication.</p>
<p>The real creative barrier isn&rsquo;t typically in the generation process itself, but in the prompts—the insights that inform decision-making. When using agent-based systems, the quality of instructions and background information directly impacts the output quality.</p>
<p>For example, advanced AI systems can now decompose complex goals like &ldquo;How can a lifestyle channel creator get 1,000 subscribers on YouTube?&rdquo; into specific tasks: analyzing successful channels, generating targeted content ideas, and implementing optimization strategies. However, the quality of these recommendations depends entirely on the AI&rsquo;s access to relevant, accurate data about what actually works.</p>
<p>By leveraging sophisticated content analysis, we can identify truly effective patterns in high-performing content. Multimodal understanding can reveal why certain creative approaches resonate with specific audiences, providing creators with concrete, unique insights rather than generic advice.</p>
<p>The future lies in connecting these insights directly to the generation process—using what we know works as the foundation for creating new content that maintains brand uniqueness while leveraging proven patterns.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-the-integration-opportunity">Conclusion: The Integration Opportunity</h2>
<p>Compared to other GenAI creative tools, insight products place greater emphasis on data quality and quantity. The next leap in AI-generated content quality will likely come from precise generation guided by robust insight data.</p>
<p>The most promising opportunity lies in creating systems that can automatically analyze successful content across platforms, extract meaningful patterns from this analysis, and directly translate these insights into generation guidance. This approach would produce highly targeted content that leverages proven patterns while maintaining brand distinctiveness.</p>
<p>As we move forward, the focus will shift from mere information generation toward sophisticated information synthesis—providing not just content, but content informed by actionable insights derived from real-world performance data. Organizations that successfully integrate insight gathering with content generation will gain a significant competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded digital landscape.</p>
<p>The future belongs not to those with the most powerful generative models, but to those who can effectively transform data into creative insight, and insight into compelling content.</p>
