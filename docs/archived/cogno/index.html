Co-founder and head of product. https://cognogpt.com\nCogno+ is dedicated to revolutionizing global e-commerce by empowering brands with AI-driven assistance that offers seamless, personalized customer experiences. Our mission is to serve as the digital bridge between brands and customers, enhancing interactions and transactions across international markets, and allowing the brand to increase conversion and upsell while reducing time and money spent on manual customer service.\nMarket Opportunity The target addressable market size is around 200K-250K, with the marketing being independent brands selling from China \u0026 Southeast Asia to the U.S. Our beachhead market is mid-sized Chinese brands selling consumer electronics and other slow-moving consumer goods to the U.S. with the annual recurring rate of more than 2 million USD, consisting around 10K potential end users. Some potential adjacent markets are China and South East Asia B2C E-commerce companies selling unbranded products to the US on their own platform that consolidates products from many factories.\nProducts \u0026 Services Cogno+ is an AI-driven interactive assistant designed to enhance e-commerce business growth. It has both personalized engagement and automated and optimized customer service. While the current chatbots and web tools still require extensive workflow setup and are limited in their problem-solving abilities, Cogno has this multi-agent real-time plug-and-play system that offers easy setup, 24-hour support, and high domain knowledge for a better personalization experience that makes us differ from other products in the competition.\nBusiness \u0026 Sales Strategy Cogno+ provides mid-sized international e-commerce brands with automated sales support to help them increase conversions and upselling. We aim to explore beyond the current boundaries of human-ai interaction, developing fully scalable sales automation systems for better engagement between brands and customers around the world.\nIn terms of our business strategy, we will employ a B2B SaaS model, charging a tier-based subscription fee based on website traffic (given the cost of using language model APIs). Our business model allows service for a range of e-commerce brands and ensures that brands only pay for the value they are getting via Cogno (increased sales conversion and product upselling).\nFor our product roadmap, building on our existing multi-agent system, we aim to continue research and development of dynamic prompting to improve the coordination capabilities of our central logic agent to allow us to leverage more custom domain agents simultaneously. We are also working to improve user interactions with graphics user interfaces and web interaction as input to language model systems. With these future improvements, we believe we are at the cusp of reinventing how online shopping interactions between brands and customers are made.\nWe will initiate customer acquisition with our beachhead market of midsized Chinese e-commerce brands selling consumer electronics and other slow-moving consumer goods to the US with an annual recurring revenue of more than 2 million, and eventually expand to the larger domestic and international e-commerce landscape. We will target customers through distribution channels such as Shopify, WooCommerce, and WordPress as well as direct sales and expo exhibitions with Chinese online retailers. By targeting industry leaders and influencers, we aim to gain a firm grounding in industries such as consumer electronics and other slow-moving consumer goods verticals. Finally, we will conduct SEO and social media marketing to expand our market beyond the Asia-Pacific to the global e-commerce market, eventually bringing Cogno+ to brands and customers in all of our major e-commerce markets.\nCredits: Jack Qidiao, Yuri Yin, Dijkstra Liu, Madison Bratley, Ryan Philips, Eric Chen, Echo Zhou, Esther Zhou, Jingfan Yao, Steven Wang, Lu Zhou, Wendy Hu, Wendy Huang, Letty Lin, Jianpeng Su, Professor Eduardo Acuna, Professor Karen Gordon, Jeff Smith, Toni Milushev, The Farley Center, The Garage, as well as everyone who provided mentorship and advice along the way.\n","wordCount":"620","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://chenterry.com/images/profile.jpg","datePublished":"2024-03-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-03-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terry Chen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://chenterry.com/archived/cogno/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Terry Chen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://chenterry.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://chenterry.com/ accesskey=h title="Terry Chen (Alt + H)">Terry Chen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=/archived/ title=Archived><span class=active>Archived</span></a></li><li><a href=/search/ title=Search accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Cogno: Multi-agent AI for sales automation</h1><div class=post-meta>Date: <span title='2024-03-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 1, 2024</span> | Author: Terry Chen</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Multi-agent system for cross boarder e-commerce sales automation.
