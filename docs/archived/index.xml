The platform aims to solve the inefficiency in the current second-hand market by simplifying the listing process through AI-generated product descriptions from images and minimal user input. By reducing friction in the listing process, Marrrket will increase the overall volume of second-hand items available in the market, creating a more efficient marketplace for both buyers and sellers. The platform&amp;rsquo;s innovation centers on using artificial intelligence to dramatically lower the barrier to entry for sellers, which is hypothesized to be the primary constraint on market growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cogno: Multi-agent AI for sales automation</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/cogno/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/cogno/</guid><description>&lt;p>Multi-agent system for cross boarder e-commerce sales automation.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Authors: Terry Chen, Kaiwen Che, Matthew Song&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Despite advances in large language model (LLM) capability, their fundamental limitation of not being able to store context over long-lived interactions persists. In this paper, a novel human-inspired three-tiered memory architecture is presented that addresses these limitations through biomimetic design principles rooted in cognitive science. Our approach aligns the human working memory with the LLM context window, episodic memory with vector stores of experience-based knowledge, and semantic memory with structured knowledge triplets.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
