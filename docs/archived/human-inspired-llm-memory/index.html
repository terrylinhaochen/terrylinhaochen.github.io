However, their architecture imposes tight constraints on memory retention and contextual comprehension during long-term interaction. Most existing LLMs operate within fixed context windows, typically ranging from 32,000 to 128,000 tokens, which impose inherent constraints on long-term conversation and complex reasoning tasks that span multiple turns.\nThe Baddeley and Hitch (1974, 2000) model of working memory provides a robust theoretical account of human information processing. The model presents memory as a multi-component system with central executive control of information flow, an episodic buffer of assembling memories into temporary experiences, a phonological loop of controlling verbal content, and a visuospatial sketchpad of controlling visual and spatial information.\nCurrent approaches to increasing LLM memory capacity heavily rely on embedding-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While the approach can deliver rapid access to previous data, it suffers greatly from issues like vector explosion, the unsustainable proliferation of embeddings as conversation history grows, lack of semantic structure in stored shreds, and difficulties in maintaining relations among relevant facts.\nThis work introduces a novel biomimetic approach to LLM memory extension that more accurately models the cognitive architecture of humans, with a three-tiered memory system distinguishing between immediate context, episodic memories, and semantic facts.\nSystem Architecture Our memory improvement system utilizes a three-layer architecture inspired by human cognition:\nWorking Memory (LLM Context Window) We divide the context window into two distinct segments:\nMulti-Round Conversation History (MCH): Stores current conversation context, maintaining flow up to a defined token limit. Retrieval Memory Buffer (RMB): Provides dedicated space for injecting remembered memories from long-term storage, maintaining a balance of short-term and long-term remembered data. Long-Term Memory Store Implemented as a vector database storing two forms of memory:\nSemantic Memory: Stores factual knowledge gained from conversations as subject-predicate-object triples with optional contextual referencing. Episodic Memory: Stores complete interaction episodes by a formal schema with contextual initialization, reasoning operations, actions taken, and outcomes observed. Memory Processes There are specialized components for:\nMemory Consolidation: Operations for capturing and formalizing memories when conversation history reaches token thresholds. Retrieval Mechanisms: Multi-step operations that determine context adequacy before retrieving from external memory stores. Memory Schema Implementation Semantic Memory Triple We implemented the semantic memory schema as a structured class:\nclass SematicMemory(BaseModel): \"\"\"Store all new facts, preferences, and relationships as triples.\"\"\" subject: str predicate: str object: str context: str | None = None Episodic Memory Schema Our episodic memory implementation stores experiential information with temporal context:\nclass EpisodicMemory(BaseModel): \"\"\"Write the episode from the perspective of the agent within it.\"\"\" observation: str = Field(..., description=\"The context and setup - what happened\") thoughts: str = Field( ..., description=\"Internal reasoning process and observations of the agent\" ) action: str = Field( ..., description=\"What was done, how, and in what format.\" ) result: str = Field( ..., description=\"Outcome and retrospective.\" ) Memory Consolidation Process The foundation of our strategy lies in sophisticated memory consolidation mechanisms that convert raw conversational information into structured memory representations:\nSemantic Memory Extraction Our semantic memory schema makes use of subject-predicate-object triples that eliminate episodic detail without sacrificing core relationships. Implementation follows several guiding principles:\nPrioritization of high-frequency accessed information Merging of redundant knowledge into a single representation Upgrading existing triples whenever new contradicting data exist Adding contextual linking to render situationally responsive retrieval Episodic Memory Extraction Episodic memory stores full interactions in an ordered schema consisting of four main components:\nObservation: Stores contextual setup and what transpired Thoughts: Stores internal reasoning processes and deliberations Action: Stores particular interventions and methodologies used Result: Stores outcome and subsequent analysis Evaluation Results GoodAI LTM benchmark results indicated radically better performance with our memory augmentation approach:\nConfiguration Score Performance Baseline GPT-4o 4.6/11 41.8% GPT-4o + Semantic Memory 6.8/11 61.8% GPT-4o + Episodic Memory 6.9/11 62.7% GPT-4o + Semantic \u0026 Episodic Memory 6.0/11 54.5% These results reflect a general 20-percentage-point improvement in memory performance by our augmentation method. The differential performance aligns with the corresponding functional roles these types of memory serve in human cognition, wherein semantic memory enables fact recall and episodic memory enables experiential reasoning.\nDiscussion and Future Work Our research provides empirical evidence for cognitive-inspired LLM memory enhancement methods. The witnessed performance improvements with three-tier memory architecture show that human memory systems offer valuable design concepts for overcoming inherent limitations in current AI designs.\nThe unexpected finding was the slightly worse performance of integrated memory systems compared to single implementations. This suggests complex interaction effects, which may mirror interference phenomena observed in human memory systems, where various forms of memory sometimes vie for mental resources.\nFuture research directions include:\nMulti-agent Memory Dynamics: How memory transfers between agents and how social dynamics influence memory consolidation Advanced Retrieval Strategies: Exploring spatially organized memory architectures and hierarchical memory organization Optimization of Consolidation Thresholds: Investigating dynamic thresholds that adapt based on conversation characteristics Conclusion This paper presents a novel biomimetic approach to enhancing LLM memory that addresses intrinsic limitations in current architectures. By embracing a three-level memory structure inspired by human cognitive processes, we demonstrate significant improvements in information retention, update, and context recall.\nAs LLMs advance towards more general intelligence capabilities, structured memory systems will play a larger role in enabling coherent long-term interactions, homogeneous knowledge states, and contextually appropriate information access. Our research contributes both pragmatic approaches for deploying this aspect of AI progress and theoretical frameworks to continue advancing this critical component of AI work.\n","wordCount":"1050","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://chenterry.com/images/profile.jpg","datePublished":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terry Chen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://chenterry.com/archived/human-inspired-llm-memory/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Terry Chen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://chenterry.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://chenterry.com/ accesskey=h title="Terry Chen (Alt + H)">Terry Chen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=/archived/ title=Archived><span class=active>Archived</span></a></li><li><a href=/search/ title=Search accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">LLM Memory Consolidation and Augmentation</h1><div class=post-meta>Date: <span title='2023-08-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 10, 2023</span> | Author: Terry Chen</div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=a-human-inspired-solution-to-llm-memory-enhancement>A Human-Inspired Solution to LLM Memory Enhancement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-human-inspired-solution-to-llm-memory-enhancement>#</a></h1><p><strong>Authors: Terry Chen, Kaiwen Che, Matthew Song</strong></p><h2 id=abstract>Abstract<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#abstract>#</a></h2><p>Despite advances in large language model (LLM) capability, their fundamental limitation of not being able to store context over long-lived interactions persists.
