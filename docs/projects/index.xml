&lt;p>Crowdlistening transforms large-scale social conversations into actionable insight by integrating llm reasoning with extensive model context protocol(MCP) capabilities. Our focus is not just on analyzing content at scale, but rather conducting original research directly from raw social data, generating insights that haven&amp;rsquo;t yet appeared in established reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deep research features provide professional-looking research reports, yet the contents are far from original, as they&amp;rsquo;re drawn from articles already indexable on the internet and paraphrased with LLMs. However, much of the internet&amp;rsquo;s data exists in unstructured formats - TikTok videos, comments, and metadata, for example. Too much content is generated every day for there to be existing articles written about it all, and when such articles are published, they&amp;rsquo;re often already outdated. When you consider multimodal data, metadata, and connections between data points, these are precisely the types of information that could yield genuinely interesting and useful insights.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insight Spotlight</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/insight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/insight/</guid><description>&lt;p>Analyze thousands of tiktoks to provide actionable trends &amp;amp; insights for key agencies.

&lt;p>In the rapidly evolving space of AI-driven creative tools, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing a significant transition from general-purpose large language models to specialized, task-specific agent systems. This shift represents a fundamental change in how AI approaches creative work, particularly in advertising and marketing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Symphony Assistant</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/copilot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/copilot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Leverage generative AI capabilities for creative script ideation and video ad creation.

&lt;p>The transition from LLMs to Agents has become a consensus in the AI community, representing an improvement in complex task execution capabilities. However, helping users fully utilize Agent capabilities to achieve tenfold efficiency gains requires careful workflow design. These workflows aren&amp;rsquo;t merely a presentation of parallel capabilities, but seamless integrations with human-in-the-loop quality assurance. This document uses Typeface as a reference to explain why a clear primary workflow is necessary, as well as design approaches for functional extensions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gauth AI</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/gauth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/gauth/</guid><description>&lt;p>AI Homework helper with advanced reasoning and visualization for all school subjects.

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Effective coaching in project-based learning environments is critical for developing students&amp;rsquo; self-regulation skills, yet scaling high-quality coaching remains a challenge. This paper presents an LLM-enhanced coaching system designed to support project-based learning by helping connect peers struggling with the same regulation gap, and to help coaches by identifying regulation gaps and generating tailored practice suggestions. Our system integrates vector-based semantic matching with LLM-generated regulation gap categorizations for Context Assessment Plan (CAP) notes. Results demonstrate that our system effectively retrieves relevant coaching cases, reducing the cognitive burden on mentors while maintaining high-quality, context-aware feedback.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
