&lt;p>When should we hire a person versus delegating to AI? Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been more reluctant towards hiring people as an attempt to build mid sized projects. Yes, the codebases would get pretty big, and there&amp;rsquo;s also tasks involved that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say are my forte exactly. Yet, when I think about the meetings I have to sit through communicating what I want to build and just time spent doing filler work, I get more and more inclined towards just doing it myself. It&amp;rsquo;s not to say that teamwork isn&amp;rsquo;t good work, some of the most creative product ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on stemmed from chats, during lunch breaks, exploring tangents, with engineers, journalists. The value of connecting the dots during these conversations is something that is difficult to replace. However, is the assumption that delegating work means higher productivity still valid? After all, the cost of execution is continually decreasing (as long as we have a clear idea of what to build).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Craft of Miyazaki in an AI-Generated World</title><link>https://chenterry.com/posts/interesting_reads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/posts/interesting_reads/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of articles / videos / podcasts that I founding interesting.

&lt;p>Hayao Miyazaki is my favorite artist and director. Though I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched his entire filmography, every moment of the films I have seen captivates me. In &amp;ldquo;Spirited Away,&amp;rdquo; the dust ball creatures exemplify his artistic prowessâ€”his ability to infuse life into the mundane through his drawings. His work is truly a labor of love. Every scene in his animated films is hand-drawn and painted with watercolor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To put this dedication in perspective: a single &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/1egdzja/this_4_second_crowd_scene_from_studio_ghiblis/">4 second crowd scene&lt;/a> from Studio Ghibli required 1 year and 3 months to complete. At 24 frames per second, that&amp;rsquo;s 96 imagesâ€”roughly 6.4 images per month or one-third of an image in an eight-hour workday. At this rate, animators would spend a decade creating just 28.8 seconds of footage. This extraordinary commitment to craft has established Miyazaki&amp;rsquo;s work as iconic for decades.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>User Needs &amp; Opportunities</title><link>https://chenterry.com/posts/user-needs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/posts/user-needs/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you want to look for user pain points, go to a bar in the middle of the week, look for the most desparate looking person and buy them a beer.

&lt;p>2024 felt to have passed by very quickly, in part because I had interesting work to occupy my time. Early in the year, after expanding Cogno and gaining some traction, work slowly stalled: though we did code and talk to customers, the cycles were far and wide in between. The focus on multi-agent systems was (as of writing this) in the right direction, yet we did not find the niche to tackle sales conversion improvement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Towards Differentiable Quality - Content Synthesis</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/personalized_content/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/personalized_content/</guid><description>&lt;p>Interactive chat interface with multiple AI agents, enabling dynamic conversation flows and specialized problem-solving capabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LLM Enhanced Recommendation and Search</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/recommendation_searh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/recommendation_searh/</guid><description>&lt;p>Content recommendation system leveraging embedding similarity for personalized content recommendation (based on profile).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring Unknown Unknowns - Textbook Interface</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/learning_interface/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/learning_interface/</guid><description>&lt;p>Interactive learning aids for reading comprehension and engagement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Realtime Conversational Learning Aid</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/groupal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/groupal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Advised by Prof. Kristian Hammond.

&lt;p>Crowdlistening transforms large-scale social conversations into actionable insight by integrating llm reasoning with extensive model context protocol(MCP) capabilities. Our focus is not just on analyzing content at scale, but rather conducting original research directly from raw social data, generating insights that haven&amp;rsquo;t yet appeared in established reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deep research features provide professional-looking research reports, yet the contents are far from original, as they&amp;rsquo;re drawn from articles already indexable on the internet and paraphrased with LLMs. However, much of the internet&amp;rsquo;s data exists in unstructured formats - TikTok videos, comments, and metadata, for example. Too much content is generated every day for there to be existing articles written about it all, and when such articles are published, they&amp;rsquo;re often already outdated. When you consider multimodal data, metadata, and connections between data points, these are precisely the types of information that could yield genuinely interesting and useful insights.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rapid Prototyping of LLM Enabled Webapps</title><link>https://chenterry.com/archived/prototyping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/archived/prototyping/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="peptalk-ai-journaling-tool">PepTalk: AI Journaling Tool&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Go deep on things. Become an expert. In particular, try to go deep on multiple things. (To varying degrees, I tried to go deep on languages, programming, writing, physics, math. Some of those stuck more than others.) One of the main things you should try to achieve by age 20 is some sense for which kinds of things you enjoy doing. This probably won&amp;rsquo;t change a lot throughout your life and so you should try to discover the shape of that space as quickly as you can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essence of Creativity</title><link>https://chenterry.com/posts/essense-of-creativity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/posts/essense-of-creativity/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week, I wanted to organize my thoughts about AI-generated content (AIGC) and creativity-related products from the past few months. Rather than focusing solely on my own projects, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore the foundational aspects of AI product design, interspersing examples from my recent work. First, I want to emphasize that technology is merely a tool intended to better serve business needs. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t significantly improve efficiency, traditional methods may be more appropriate. Second, despite the many imaginative possibilities of current technology, applications should ultimately be guided by user needs. Finally, AI technologies and markets evolve rapidly, making predictions difficult to validate, but exploring content understanding and generation remains an intriguing challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insight Spotlight</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/insight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/insight/</guid><description>&lt;p>Analyze thousands of tiktoks to provide actionable trends &amp;amp; insights for key agencies.

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Despite advances in large language model (LLM) capability, their fundamental limitation of not being able to store context over long-lived interactions persists. In this paper, a novel human-inspired three-tiered memory architecture is presented that addresses these limitations through biomimetic design principles rooted in cognitive science. Our approach aligns the human working memory with the LLM context window, episodic memory with vector stores of experience-based knowledge, and semantic memory with structured knowledge triplets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving &amp; Scaling LLMs for Coaching</title><link>https://chenterry.com/projects/improving-scaling-llms-coaching/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/projects/improving-scaling-llms-coaching/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="situated-practice-systems-improving-and-scaling-coaching-through-llms">Situated Practice Systems: Improving and Scaling Coaching through LLMs&lt;/h1>

&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Effective coaching in project-based learning environments is critical for developing students&amp;rsquo; self-regulation skills, yet scaling high-quality coaching remains a challenge. This paper presents an LLM-enhanced coaching system designed to support project-based learning by helping connect peers struggling with the same regulation gap, and to help coaches by identifying regulation gaps and generating tailored practice suggestions. Our system integrates vector-based semantic matching with LLM-generated regulation gap categorizations for Context Assessment Plan (CAP) notes. Results demonstrate that our system effectively retrieves relevant coaching cases, reducing the cognitive burden on mentors while maintaining high-quality, context-aware feedback.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://chenterry.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenterry.com/about/</guid><description>About Terry Chen</description></item></channel></rss>
