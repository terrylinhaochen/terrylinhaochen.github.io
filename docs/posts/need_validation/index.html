  "articleBody": "Why We Need More Ways to Hear Customers Your last customer call was three weeks ago. Your PM dashboard shows green metrics. Yet your latest feature has a 12% adoption rate, and the support tickets keep growing. Sound familiar?\nHere’s the trap every growing product team falls into: you start with great customer connections, but success creates distance. Suddenly you’re building for your five power users while 95% of your market stays silent. The result? Products that feel over-engineered to newcomers and underwhelming to everyone else. We end up in what I call the “vocal minority trap”—building for the loudest voices while missing authentic needs from the broader market.\nWith AI-powered social listening tools and tighter feedback loops, we can flip from product → market to market → product development. Instead of building first and hoping for adoption, we can listen broadly to authentic customer discourse, form grounded hypotheses from real needs, then decide what to build. This approach lets us partner closely with key customers while staying connected to the broader market conversation.\nThe AI Way to Do It Traditional social listening tells you what people think about your brand. But what if you could use the same approach to discover what products people actually need—before you build them?\nBeyond internal testers and formal user research channels, the internet already hosts rich, authentic signals about how products—yours and competitors’—land in the real world. Community forums, Q\u0026A sites, GitHub issues, Reddit threads, and support communities contain unfiltered customer discourse about pain points, expectations, and the exact language users employ when describing their needs. If we capture, filter, and analyze that discourse responsibly, we get a truer view of market needs than traditional research methods often provide.\nPractical workflow The system operates through two complementary approaches based on your research needs. Targeted discovery works best when you have specific product questions—like “why do users abandon our checkout flow?” Here, we compile a focused corpus from relevant public discussions (support forums, Reddit threads, GitHub issues), extract and normalize the text, then use large-context LLMs to identify and synthesize recurring themes with direct citations back to source material.\nOpen-ended exploration suits broader market research where you’re not sure what patterns might emerge. This approach generates embeddings at both sentence and discussion levels, applies semantic clustering to group similar concerns naturally, and labels each cluster with evidence-linked summaries. The goal isn’t to confirm existing hypotheses but to discover what customers actually discuss when they think no one from your company is listening.\nEvery discovered theme flows into a structured decision scaffold: theme → testable hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement. This prevents what I call “insight theater”—beautiful dashboards that don’t change what gets built. For example, discovering that users frequently mention “billing confusion” becomes the hypothesis “clearer usage breakdowns will reduce support tickets,” which becomes the bet “redesign invoice layout,” measured through “support ticket volume” and refined based on actual outcomes.\nLonger-term, the system runs as an always-on Customer Insight Radar that continuously ingests external communities alongside internal customer notes (with appropriate privacy filters). It tracks theme velocity—which concerns are growing versus shrinking—and maintains representative quotes so product managers and engineers can feel the human reality behind abstract metrics.\nPrimary vs. secondary sources When building your corpus, it’s crucial to distinguish between primary and secondary sources to maximize insight quality. Treat raw online discourse—posts, threads, issue comments, and direct user communications—as primary research. These represent unfiltered customer voices expressing genuine needs and frustrations in their own language. In contrast, polished content like vendor blog posts, marketing materials, and SEO-optimized pages should be considered secondary sources that often reflect corporate messaging rather than authentic user experience.\nMany “deep research” tools inadvertently amplify secondary sources because they index what’s easily crawlable and well-structured, leading to summaries of summaries rather than original insights. Our approach prioritizes going directly to the source, weighting firsthand accounts more heavily, and using secondary material only for background context or to triangulate findings from primary sources.\nA Bit More on Embeddings (and Why They Help) Think of embeddings as a way to teach computers what words and sentences actually mean. Instead of just matching exact keywords, AI can understand that “billing is confusing” and “invoices are unclear” are talking about the same problem, even though they use different words.\nEarly embedding methods learned one meaning per word—fast and useful for basic clustering, but they missed context. The word “bill” could mean an invoice or a proposed law, and the system couldn’t tell the difference. Modern contextual encoders solve this by creating different representations for the same word depending on how it’s used, then combining these into sentence and document-level meanings.\nFor social listening, sentence and document embeddings are the workhorses that enable semantic search (finding “unreconcilable line items” when someone searches for “can’t map charges to usage”), organic theme discovery without predefined categories, and tracking how customer language evolves over time. In practice, we create embeddings at both sentence and full discussion levels, use ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) indexing for fast retrieval, and employ clustering methods that can handle the uneven, natural shape of real community discussions—always linking themes back to actual customer quotes for transparency.\nReasoning Models and Visualizations With smaller datasets, we can directly provide the extracted raw text to a large-context, strong-reasoning model. This goes beyond coarse sentiment categories or word clouds, enabling richer context and actionable insights. Curated prompts let an LLM (or agent) read the semantic neighborhoods, surface key themes, note counter-signals, and propose testable hypotheses.\nHarvesting Customer Testimonials at Scale One particularly powerful application involves extracting authentic customer impact stories from large collections of interview transcripts and recorded conversations. Rather than manually combing through dozens of hours of customer calls, modern AI tools can systematically identify and structure testimonial content in minutes rather than days.\nThe workflow is surprisingly straightforward: First, transcribe customer interviews, podcast episodes, or recorded calls using automated transcription services. Next, upload these transcripts to large-context reasoning models like NotebookLM or Claude. Then ask the AI to identify every quote describing specific product impact, organizing results into structured tables with columns for quote, customer name, company, and use case. Finally, use AI-powered copywriting tools to convert raw testimonials into polished, punchy customer quotes suitable for marketing materials.\nThis approach transforms 1-2 days of manual testimonial extraction into under an hour of guided AI work. More importantly, it ensures comprehensive coverage—human reviewers naturally miss valuable quotes buried in lengthy conversations, while AI can systematically process every statement for relevant content. The result is a richer, more complete picture of how customers actually describe your product’s value in their own language.\nDetailed thematic analysis reveals customer pain points through AI-powered clustering and sentiment analysis, enabling product teams to identify high-impact opportunities from authentic user discourse.\nThe insights dashboard translates raw social listening data into actionable product decisions, showing priority themes, opportunity sizing, and specific customer quotes that ground each recommendation in real user needs.\nWhat the output is—and isn’t The analysis output serves as a decision input rather than a presentation deck. Each synthesized theme should directly map to three actionable components: a testable product hypothesis that can be validated or refuted, an opportunity-size signal that helps prioritize resources, and a specific instrumentation plan that will measure success. This maintains the same decision scaffold mentioned earlier, ensuring that insights translate into concrete product decisions rather than remaining as interesting but unused research findings.\nSeeing It in Action Example 1: The Cost Experience From ~700 candidate threads, we curated ~100 high-signal discussions (Reddit, HN, Quora, vendor/community forums), normalized text, embedded at sentence/thread level, clustered themes, and linked each to example quotes. One dominant signal emerged: billing complexity and transparency drive most cost-related UX pain. Users struggle to reconcile invoices to usage, discover overruns after month-end, and use calculators that ignore dynamic workloads—leading to surprise spikes. Strategically, users prefer predictable costs over merely lower costs. The advantage is cost-experience design (real-time transparency, proactive controls, behavior-aware forecasting) rather than discounts alone. Platform “flavors” vary (e.g., BigQuery pricing confusion, Snowflake credit visibility, Databricks cluster trade-offs, Splunk ingestion spikes, Redshift monitoring blind spots), but the design response is consistent: plain-English cost impact at point of action, pre-threshold alerts, safe throttles, and workload-aware forecasting.\nExample 2: Tier-2 SOC Analyst Friction When we analyzed discussions from cybersecurity forums and support communities, five universal barriers emerged across different security tools:\nQuery language complexity: Analysts struggle with proprietary search syntaxes that vary across platforms False-positive overload: Too many alerts that turn out to be benign, creating alert fatigue Integration hurdles: Data silos prevent effective correlation between security tools Workflow friction: Constant context switching and manual processes break investigation flow Platform limitations: Analysts spend time troubleshooting tools rather than investigating threats The design mandate became clear: lower technical barriers, suppress noise, preserve investigative context, and streamline common workflows so analysts can focus on actual threats rather than tool mechanics. The most impactful solutions involved agentic experiences that automate routine tasks and stronger default configurations that require less customization.\nCrowdlistening’s main interface provides a clean entry point for product teams to analyze community discussions, with options for targeted discovery, open-ended exploration, and always-on insight monitoring.\nThe analysis workspace combines semantic search, clustering algorithms, and LLM reasoning to surface patterns in customer discourse while maintaining traceability back to original sources.\nCrowdlistening As shown in the cost-estimation agent presentation, Crowdlistening is a tool I built to extract patterns from collective discourse without flattening individual voices. It pairs LLM reasoning with a larger-context pipeline to ingest public discussions, structure them, and tie findings back to evidence. At its core, Crowdlistening treats raw discourse as primary data, emphasizes traceability (“show your work”), and optimizes for original insight over derivative summaries.\nCrowdlistening’s goal isn’t forced consensus; it’s to surface authentic needs, native customer language, and edge cases that formal channels miss. At enterprise scale—where the user base is large and diverse—listening broadly helps us prioritize what’s real over what’s merely loud. (More background at Crowdlistening.com.)\nSince the launch of MCPs, I’ve experimented with exposing Crowdlistening capabilities as MCP servers—directly accessible in clients like Copilot or Claude. Features remain similar (with some visualization limits), but inputs become more nuanced and multi-turn, making the experience far more intuitive for non-technical users.\nBuilding This at Large Organizations A Feature Proposal To enable the market → product workflow at enterprise scale, we could develop a Copilot MCP integration that serves as a conversational guide for early specification writing. This tool would fundamentally change how product requirements are generated by starting with customer evidence rather than internal assumptions.\nThe system would ingest customer meeting transcripts alongside curated online discussions, applying the same semantic analysis techniques to identify patterns across both formal and informal feedback channels. It would run evidence-linked synthesis with clear citations to primary sources, ensuring that every product decision can trace back to specific customer voices. Most importantly, it would automatically generate the theme → hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement scaffolds that slot directly into product specifications, making the customer-driven development process systematic rather than ad-hoc.\nGovernance and Guardrails Social data presents unique challenges around privacy, bias, and accuracy that require systematic safeguards. Our approach emphasizes ethical data collection through strict sourcing practices that respect user consent, aggressive deduplication to prevent over-weighting vocal users, and zero tolerance for capturing personally identifiable information. The goal is to understand collective patterns without compromising individual privacy.\nTo combat sampling bias—a critical risk when community discussions may not represent your full user base—we actively measure representativeness across demographics, use cases, and engagement levels. Every synthesized claim maintains auditable links back to source material, implementing a “show your work” principle that allows stakeholders to verify the evidence behind recommendations. Finally, we use MCP-based connectors to ensure data processing pipelines remain inspectable and secure, with clear governance over what data flows where and how it’s transformed.\nClosing Thought AI-enabled social listening doesn’t replace customer calls, design research, or telemetry; it enriches them—especially at the fuzzy front end. Used well, it helps us choose better problems, write crisper specs, and ship experiences that feel obvious in hindsight.\n",

    <h2 id="why-we-need-more-ways-to-hear-customers">Why We Need More Ways to Hear Customers</h2>
<p>Your last customer call was three weeks ago. Your PM dashboard shows green metrics. Yet your latest feature has a 12% adoption rate, and the support tickets keep growing. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the trap every growing product team falls into: you start with great customer connections, but success creates distance. Suddenly you&rsquo;re building for your five power users while 95% of your market stays silent. The result? Products that feel over-engineered to newcomers and underwhelming to everyone else. We end up in what I call the &ldquo;vocal minority trap&rdquo;—building for the loudest voices while missing authentic needs from the broader market.</p>
<p>With AI-powered social listening tools and tighter feedback loops, we can flip from product → market to market → product development. Instead of building first and hoping for adoption, we can listen broadly to authentic customer discourse, form grounded hypotheses from real needs, then decide what to build. This approach lets us partner closely with key customers while staying connected to the broader market conversation.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/microsoft-sentinel-overview.png" alt="Microsoft Sentinel Analysis Overview" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<h2 id="the-ai-way-to-do-it">The AI Way to Do It</h2>
<p>Traditional social listening tells you what people think about your brand. But what if you could use the same approach to discover what products people actually need—before you build them?</p>
<p>Beyond internal testers and formal user research channels, the internet already hosts rich, authentic signals about how products—yours and competitors&rsquo;—land in the real world. Community forums, Q&amp;A sites, GitHub issues, Reddit threads, and support communities contain unfiltered customer discourse about pain points, expectations, and the exact language users employ when describing their needs. If we capture, filter, and analyze that discourse responsibly, we get a truer view of market needs than traditional research methods often provide.</p>
<h3 id="practical-workflow">Practical workflow</h3>
<p>The system operates through two complementary approaches based on your research needs. <strong>Targeted discovery</strong> works best when you have specific product questions—like &ldquo;why do users abandon our checkout flow?&rdquo; Here, we compile a focused corpus from relevant public discussions (support forums, Reddit threads, GitHub issues), extract and normalize the text, then use large-context LLMs to identify and synthesize recurring themes with direct citations back to source material.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ended exploration</strong> suits broader market research where you&rsquo;re not sure what patterns might emerge. This approach generates embeddings at both sentence and discussion levels, applies semantic clustering to group similar concerns naturally, and labels each cluster with evidence-linked summaries. The goal isn&rsquo;t to confirm existing hypotheses but to discover what customers actually discuss when they think no one from your company is listening.</p>
<p>Every discovered theme flows into a structured decision scaffold: <strong>theme</strong> → <strong>testable hypothesis</strong> → <strong>bet</strong> → <strong>telemetry</strong> → <strong>refinement</strong>. This prevents what I call &ldquo;insight theater&rdquo;—beautiful dashboards that don&rsquo;t change what gets built. For example, discovering that users frequently mention &ldquo;billing confusion&rdquo; becomes the hypothesis &ldquo;clearer usage breakdowns will reduce support tickets,&rdquo; which becomes the bet &ldquo;redesign invoice layout,&rdquo; measured through &ldquo;support ticket volume&rdquo; and refined based on actual outcomes.</p>
<p>Longer-term, the system runs as an always-on Customer Insight Radar that continuously ingests external communities alongside internal customer notes (with appropriate privacy filters). It tracks theme velocity—which concerns are growing versus shrinking—and maintains representative quotes so product managers and engineers can feel the human reality behind abstract metrics.</p>
<p>

  <img src="/images/projects/crowdlistening/sentiment-breakdown.png" alt="Audience Sentiment Analysis" loading="lazy">
 </p>
<h3 id="primary-vs-secondary-sources">Primary vs. secondary sources</h3>
<p>When building your corpus, it&rsquo;s crucial to distinguish between primary and secondary sources to maximize insight quality. Treat raw online discourse—posts, threads, issue comments, and direct user communications—as primary research. These represent unfiltered customer voices expressing genuine needs and frustrations in their own language. In contrast, polished content like vendor blog posts, marketing materials, and SEO-optimized pages should be considered secondary sources that often reflect corporate messaging rather than authentic user experience.</p>
<p>Many &ldquo;deep research&rdquo; tools inadvertently amplify secondary sources because they index what&rsquo;s easily crawlable and well-structured, leading to summaries of summaries rather than original insights. Our approach prioritizes going directly to the source, weighting firsthand accounts more heavily, and using secondary material only for background context or to triangulate findings from primary sources.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-more-on-embeddings-and-why-they-help">A Bit More on Embeddings (and Why They Help)</h2>
<p>Think of embeddings as a way to teach computers what words and sentences actually mean. Instead of just matching exact keywords, AI can understand that &ldquo;billing is confusing&rdquo; and &ldquo;invoices are unclear&rdquo; are talking about the same problem, even though they use different words.</p>
<p>Early embedding methods learned one meaning per word—fast and useful for basic clustering, but they missed context. The word &ldquo;bill&rdquo; could mean an invoice or a proposed law, and the system couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference. Modern contextual encoders solve this by creating different representations for the same word depending on how it&rsquo;s used, then combining these into sentence and document-level meanings.</p>
<p>For social listening, sentence and document embeddings are the workhorses that enable semantic search (finding &ldquo;unreconcilable line items&rdquo; when someone searches for &ldquo;can&rsquo;t map charges to usage&rdquo;), organic theme discovery without predefined categories, and tracking how customer language evolves over time. In practice, we create embeddings at both sentence and full discussion levels, use ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) indexing for fast retrieval, and employ clustering methods that can handle the uneven, natural shape of real community discussions—always linking themes back to actual customer quotes for transparency.</p>
<h2 id="reasoning-models-and-visualizations">Reasoning Models and Visualizations</h2>
<p>With smaller datasets, we can directly provide the extracted raw text to a large-context, strong-reasoning model. This goes beyond coarse sentiment categories or word clouds, enabling richer context and actionable insights. Curated prompts let an LLM (or agent) read the semantic neighborhoods, surface key themes, note counter-signals, and propose testable hypotheses.</p>
<h3 id="harvesting-customer-testimonials-at-scale">Harvesting Customer Testimonials at Scale</h3>
<p>One particularly powerful application involves extracting authentic customer impact stories from large collections of interview transcripts and recorded conversations. Rather than manually combing through dozens of hours of customer calls, modern AI tools can systematically identify and structure testimonial content in minutes rather than days.</p>
<p>The workflow is surprisingly straightforward: First, transcribe customer interviews, podcast episodes, or recorded calls using automated transcription services. Next, upload these transcripts to large-context reasoning models like NotebookLM or Claude. Then ask the AI to identify every quote describing specific product impact, organizing results into structured tables with columns for quote, customer name, company, and use case. Finally, use AI-powered copywriting tools to convert raw testimonials into polished, punchy customer quotes suitable for marketing materials.</p>
<p>This approach transforms 1-2 days of manual testimonial extraction into under an hour of guided AI work. More importantly, it ensures comprehensive coverage—human reviewers naturally miss valuable quotes buried in lengthy conversations, while AI can systematically process every statement for relevant content. The result is a richer, more complete picture of how customers actually describe your product&rsquo;s value in their own language.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-output-isand-isnt">What the output is—and isn&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>The analysis output serves as a decision input rather than a presentation deck. Each synthesized theme should directly map to three actionable components: a testable product hypothesis that can be validated or refuted, an opportunity-size signal that helps prioritize resources, and a specific instrumentation plan that will measure success. This maintains the same decision scaffold mentioned earlier, ensuring that insights translate into concrete product decisions rather than remaining as interesting but unused research findings.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-it-in-action">Seeing It in Action</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-the-cost-experience">Example 1: The Cost Experience</h3>
<p>From ~700 candidate threads, we curated ~100 high-signal discussions (Reddit, HN, Quora, vendor/community forums), normalized text, embedded at sentence/thread level, clustered themes, and linked each to example quotes. One dominant signal emerged: billing complexity and transparency drive most cost-related UX pain. Users struggle to reconcile invoices to usage, discover overruns after month-end, and use calculators that ignore dynamic workloads—leading to surprise spikes. Strategically, users prefer predictable costs over merely lower costs. The advantage is cost-experience design (real-time transparency, proactive controls, behavior-aware forecasting) rather than discounts alone. Platform “flavors” vary (e.g., BigQuery pricing confusion, Snowflake credit visibility, Databricks cluster trade-offs, Splunk ingestion spikes, Redshift monitoring blind spots), but the design response is consistent: plain-English cost impact at point of action, pre-threshold alerts, safe throttles, and workload-aware forecasting.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-tier-2-soc-analyst-friction">Example 2: Tier-2 SOC Analyst Friction</h3>
<p>When we analyzed discussions from cybersecurity forums and support communities, five universal barriers emerged across different security tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Query language complexity</strong>: Analysts struggle with proprietary search syntaxes that vary across platforms</li>
<li><strong>False-positive overload</strong>: Too many alerts that turn out to be benign, creating alert fatigue</li>
<li><strong>Integration hurdles</strong>: Data silos prevent effective correlation between security tools</li>
<li><strong>Workflow friction</strong>: Constant context switching and manual processes break investigation flow</li>
<li><strong>Platform limitations</strong>: Analysts spend time troubleshooting tools rather than investigating threats</li>
</ol>
<p>The design mandate became clear: lower technical barriers, suppress noise, preserve investigative context, and streamline common workflows so analysts can focus on actual threats rather than tool mechanics. The most impactful solutions involved agentic experiences that automate routine tasks and stronger default configurations that require less customization.</p>

<em>The analysis workspace combines semantic search, clustering algorithms, and LLM reasoning to surface patterns in customer discourse while maintaining traceability back to original sources.</em></p>
<h2 id="crowdlistening">Crowdlistening</h2>
<p>As shown in the cost-estimation agent presentation, Crowdlistening is a tool I built to extract patterns from collective discourse without flattening individual voices. It pairs LLM reasoning with a larger-context pipeline to ingest public discussions, structure them, and tie findings back to evidence. At its core, Crowdlistening treats raw discourse as primary data, emphasizes traceability (“show your work”), and optimizes for original insight over derivative summaries.</p>
<p>Crowdlistening&rsquo;s goal isn&rsquo;t forced consensus; it&rsquo;s to surface authentic needs, native customer language, and edge cases that formal channels miss. At enterprise scale—where the user base is large and diverse—listening broadly helps us prioritize what&rsquo;s real over what&rsquo;s merely loud. (More background at Crowdlistening.com.)</p>
<p>Since the launch of MCPs, I&rsquo;ve experimented with exposing Crowdlistening capabilities as MCP servers—directly accessible in clients like Copilot or Claude. Features remain similar (with some visualization limits), but inputs become more nuanced and multi-turn, making the experience far more intuitive for non-technical users.</p>
<h2 id="building-this-at-large-organizations">Building This at Large Organizations</h2>
<h3 id="a-feature-proposal">A Feature Proposal</h3>
<p>To enable the market → product workflow at enterprise scale, we could develop a Copilot MCP integration that serves as a conversational guide for early specification writing. This tool would fundamentally change how product requirements are generated by starting with customer evidence rather than internal assumptions.</p>
<p>The system would ingest customer meeting transcripts alongside curated online discussions, applying the same semantic analysis techniques to identify patterns across both formal and informal feedback channels. It would run evidence-linked synthesis with clear citations to primary sources, ensuring that every product decision can trace back to specific customer voices. Most importantly, it would automatically generate the theme → hypothesis → bet → telemetry → refinement scaffolds that slot directly into product specifications, making the customer-driven development process systematic rather than ad-hoc.</p>
<h3 id="governance-and-guardrails">Governance and Guardrails</h3>
<p>Social data presents unique challenges around privacy, bias, and accuracy that require systematic safeguards. Our approach emphasizes ethical data collection through strict sourcing practices that respect user consent, aggressive deduplication to prevent over-weighting vocal users, and zero tolerance for capturing personally identifiable information. The goal is to understand collective patterns without compromising individual privacy.</p>
<p>To combat sampling bias—a critical risk when community discussions may not represent your full user base—we actively measure representativeness across demographics, use cases, and engagement levels. Every synthesized claim maintains auditable links back to source material, implementing a &ldquo;show your work&rdquo; principle that allows stakeholders to verify the evidence behind recommendations. Finally, we use MCP-based connectors to ensure data processing pipelines remain inspectable and secure, with clear governance over what data flows where and how it&rsquo;s transformed.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thought">Closing Thought</h2>
<p>AI-enabled social listening doesn’t replace customer calls, design research, or telemetry; it enriches them—especially at the fuzzy front end. Used well, it helps us choose better problems, write crisper specs, and ship experiences that feel obvious in hindsight.</p>
