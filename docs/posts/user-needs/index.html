It’s also interesting to consider the two approaches towards web navigation: vision-based and ai-native-ui. While people like Aravind Srinivas have openly expressed their skepicism towards vision based web operations, noting the limitations imposed by operating systems, especially iOS, which restrict access to other applications, vision-based web interactions are inherently more versatile and flexible.\nContent generation: Generative ai is at its core, generative. We have for the past three years seen numerous improvements in text/image/video/avatar generation, with applications in vairous forms of UGC (and now nearing PGC) ads, podcasts, short-form videos.
