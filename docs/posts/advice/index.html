It should be a factor you weigh but not by itself dispositive.\nTo the extent that you enjoy working hard, do. Subject to that constraint, it’s not clear that the returns to effort ever diminish substantially. If you’re lucky enough to enjoy it a lot, be grateful and take full advantage!\nMake friends over the internet with people who are great at things you’re interested in. The internet is one of the biggest advantages you have over prior generations. Leverage it.\nAim to read a lot.\nIf you think something is important but people older than you don’t hold it in high regard, there’s a reasonable chance that you’re right and they’re wrong. Status lags by a generation or more.\nAbove all else, don’t make the mistake of judging your success based on your current peer group. By all means make friends but being weird as a teenager is generally good.\nBut having good social skills confers life-long benefits. So, don’t write them off. Get good at making a good first impression, being funny (if possible… this author still working on it…), speaking publicly.\nMake things. Operating in a space with a lot of uncertainty is a very different experience to learning something.\nMore broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn’t be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions.\nIf you’re in the US and go to a good school, there are a lot of forces that will push you towards following traintracks laid by others rather than charting a course yourself. Make sure that the things you’re pursuing are weird things that you want to pursue, not whatever the standard path is. Heuristic: do your friends at school think your path is a bit strange? If not, maybe it’s too normal.\nFigure out a way to travel to San Francisco and to meet other people who’ve moved there to pursue their dreams. Why San Francisco? San Francisco is the Schelling point for high-openness, smart, energetic, optimistic people. Global Weird HQ. Take advantage of opportunities to travel to other places too, of course.\nFind vivid examples of success in the domains you care about. If you want to become a great scientist, try to find ways to spend time with good (or, ideally, great) scientists in person. Watch YouTube videos of interviews. Follow some on Twitter.\nPeople who did great things often did so at very surprisingly young ages. (They were grayhaired when they became famous… not when they did the work.) So, hurry up! You can do great things.\nPaul Graham - How to do Great Work ","wordCount":"607","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://chenterry.com/images/profile.jpg","datePublished":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, etc"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://chenterry.com/posts/advice/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Terry Chen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://chenterry.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://chenterry.com/ accesskey=h title="Terry Chen (Alt + H)">Terry Chen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=/posts/ title=Posts><span class=active>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=/archived/ title=Archived><span>Archived</span></a></li><li><a href=/search/ title=Search accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Advice</h1><div class=post-meta>Date: <span title='2024-09-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 1, 2024</span> | Author: Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, etc</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Every now and then I like to read about the advice of others who&rsquo;ve succeeded in their field.
